Definitely something out there,\\r\\nCaptain, headed this way. \\r\\nTYLER: It could be these meteorites. \\r\\nONE: No, it's something else. There's still something out there. \\r\\nTYLER: It's coming at the speed of light, collision course. The\\r\\nmeteorite beam has not deflected it, Captain.\\r\\nONE: Evasive manoeuvres, sir?\\r\\nPIKE: Steady as we go.\\r\\nGARISON: It's a radio wave, sir. We're passing through an old-style\\r\\ndistress signal.\\r\\nPIKE: They were keyed to cause interference and attract attention this\\r\\nway.\\r\\nGARISON: A ship in trouble making a forced landing, sir. That's it. No\\r\\nother message.\\r\\nTYLER: I have a fix. It comes from the Talos star group.\\r\\nONE: We've no ships or Earth colonies that far out.\\r\\nSPOCK: Their call letters check with a survey expedition. SS Columbia.\\r\\nIt disappeared in that region approximately eighteen years ago.\\r\\nTYLER: It would take that long for a radio beam to travel from there to\\r\\nhere.\\r\\nSPOCK: Records show the Talos group has never been explored. Solar\\r\\nsystem similar to Earth, eleven planets. Number four seems to be Class\\r\\nM, oxygen atmosphere.\\r\\nONE: Then they could still be alive, even after eighteen years.\\r\\nPIKE: If they survived the crash.\\r\\nSPOCK: We aren't going to go, to be certain?\\r\\nPIKE: Not without any indication of survivors, no. Continue to the Vega\\r\\nColony and take care of our own sick and injured first. You have the\\r\\nhelm. Maintain present course.\\r\\nONE: Yes, sir.\\r\\n\\n[Pike's quarters]\\n\\nBOYCE [OC}: Boyce here.\\r\\nPIKE: Drop by my cabin, Doctor. (Boyce enters with bag) What's that? I\\r\\ndidn't say there's anything wrong with me.\\r\\nBOYCE: I understand we picked up a distress signal.\\r\\nPIKE: That's right. Unless we get anything more positive on it, it\\r\\nseems to me the condition of our own crew takes precedent. I'd like to\\r\\nlog the ship's doctor's opinion, too.\\r\\nBOYCE: Oh, I concur with yours, definitely.\\r\\nPIKE: Good. I'm glad you do, because we're going to stop first at the\\r\\nVega Colony and replace anybody who needs hospitalisation and also.\\r\\nWhat the devil are you putting in there, ice?\\r\\nBOYCE: Who wants a warm martini?\\r\\nPIKE: What makes you think I need one?\\r\\nBOYCE: Sometimes a man'll tell his bartender things he'll never tell\\r\\nhis doctor. What's been on your mind, Chris, the fight on Rigel Seven?\\r\\nPIKE: Shouldn't it be? My own yeoman and two others dead, seven\\r\\ninjured.\\r\\nBOYCE: Was there anything you personally could have done to prevent it?\\r\\nPIKE: Oh, I should have smelled trouble when I saw the swords and the\\r\\narmour. Instead of that, I let myself get trapped in that deserted\\r\\nfortress and attacked by one of their warriors.\\r\\nBOYCE: Chris, you set standards for yourself no one could meet. You\\r\\ntreat everyone on board like a human being except yourself, and now\\r\\nyou're tired and you\\r\\nPIKE: You bet I'm tired. You bet. I'm tired of being responsible for\\r\\ntwo hundred and three lives. I'm tired of deciding which mission is too\\r\\nrisky and which isn't, and who's going on the landing party and who\\r\\ndoesn't, and who lives and who dies. Boy, I've had it, Phil.\\r\\nBOYCE: To the point of finally taking my advice, a rest leave?\\r\\nPIKE: To the point of considering resigning.\\r\\nBOYCE: And do what?\\r\\nPIKE: Well, for one thing, go home. Nice little town with fifty miles\\r\\nof parkland around it. Remember I told you I had two horses, and we\\r\\nused to take some food and ride out all day.\\r\\nBOYCE: Ah, that sounds exciting. Ride out with a picnic lunch every day.\\r\\nPIKE: I said that's one place I might go. I might go into business on\\r\\nRegulus or on the Orion colony.\\r\\nBOYCE: You, an Orion trader, dealing in green animal women, slaves?\\r\\nPIKE: The point is this isn't the only life available. There's a whole\\r\\ngalaxy of things to choose from.\\r\\nBOYCE: Not for you. A man either lives life as it happens to him, meets\\r\\nit head-on, and licks it, or he turns his back on it and starts to\\r\\nwither away.\\r\\nPIKE: Now you're beginning to talk like a doctor, bartender.\\r\\nBOYCE: Take your choice. We both get the same two kinds of customers.\\r\\nThe living and the dying.\\r\\nSPOCK [on monitor]: Mister Spock here. We're intercepting a follow-up\\r\\nmessage, sir. There are crash survivors on Talos.\\r\\n\\n[Bridge]\\n\\nGARISON: (reads) Eleven survivors from crash.\\r\\nGravity and oxygen within limits. Food and water obtainable, but\\r\\nunless. The message faded at that point, sir.\\r\\nPIKE: Address intercraft.\\r\\nTYLER: System open.\\r\\nPIKE: This is the captain. Our destination is the Talos star group. Our\\r\\ntime warp, factor seven.\\r\\nTYLER: Course computed and on the screen.\\r\\nONE: All decks have acknowledged, sir.\\r\\nPIKE : Engage.\\r\\nTYLER: On course, sir. \\r\\n(Colt enters. Pike turns around and bumps into her) \\r\\nPIKE: Yeoman. \\r\\nCOLT: Yes, sir. \\r\\nPIKE: I thought I told you that when I'm on the bridge \\r\\nCOLT: But you wanted the reports by oh five hundred. It's oh five\\r\\nhundred now, sir. \\r\\nPIKE: Oh, I see. Thank you. \\r\\nONE: She's replacing your former yeoman, sir. \\r\\nPIKE: She does a good job, all right. It's just that I can't get used\\r\\nto having a woman on the bridge. No offence, Lieutenant. You're\\r\\ndifferent, of course. \\r\\n(The Enterprise arrives at a planet) \\r\\nTYLER: We've settled into orbit, sir.\\r\\nGEOLOGIST: Geological lab report complete, Captain.\\r\\nSPOCK: Preliminary lab survey ready, sir.\\r\\nPIKE: Spectography?\\r\\nGEOLOGIST: Our reading shows an oxygen nitrogen atmosphere, sir, heavy\\r\\nwith inert elements but well within safety limits.\\r\\nPIKE: Gravity?\\r\\nGEOLOGIST: Zero point nine of Earth.\\r\\nTYLER: Captain? Reflections, sir, from the planet's surface. As I read\\r\\nit, they polarise out as rounded metal bits. Could be parts of a\\r\\nspaceship hull.\\r\\nPIKE: Prep a landing party of six. You feel up to it?\\r\\nSPOCK: Yes, sir.\\r\\nTYLER: Yes, sir. \\r\\nPIKE: Sorry, Number One. With little information on this planet, we'll\\r\\nhave to leave the ship's most experienced officer here covering us.\\r\\nONE: Of course, sir.\\r\\n\\n[Transporter room]\\n\\nPIKE: There's no indication of problems down there,\\r\\nbut let's not take chances.\\r\\nPITCAIRN: Yes, sir. There's a canyon to the left. We can set you there\\r\\ncompletely unobserved.\\r\\n\\n[Planet surface]\\n\\n(the group explores until they find a rough\\r\\nsettlement) \\r\\nGARISON: Sir.\\r\\nOLD MAN: They're men. They're humans.\\r\\nPIKE: Captain Christopher Pike, United Space Ship Enterprise.\\r\\nHASKINS: Doctor Theodore Haskins, American Continent lnstitute.\\r\\nSURVIVOR: Is Earth all right?\\r\\nPIKE: The same old Earth, and you'll see it very soon.\\r\\nTYLER: And you won't believe how fast you can get back. Well the time\\r\\nbarrier's been broken. Our new ships can\\r\\n(He's struck dumb by the sight of a lovely young woman) \\r\\nHASKINS: This is Vina. Her parents are dead. She was born almost as we\\r\\ncrashed.\\r\\n(The reunion is being watched on another screen, by three people with\\r\\nbig bald heads) \\r\\nPIKE: (as the survivors pack up the settlement) Enterprise.\\r\\nONE [OC]: Landing party, come in.\\r\\nPIKE: We'll begin transporting the survivors and their effects up to\\r\\nyou very shortly.\\r\\nONE [OC]: Quarters are being prepared, sir. Have I permission to send\\r\\nout scouting and scientific parties now?\\r\\nPIKE: That's affirmative on the\\r\\nVINA: You appear to be healthy and intelligent, Captain. A prime\\r\\nspecimen.\\r\\nONE [OC]: I didn't get that last message, Captain.\\r\\nPIKE: Er, affirmative on request. Landing party out.\\r\\nHASKINS: You must forgive her choice of words, Captain. She's lived her\\r\\nwhole life with a collection of aging scientists.\\r\\nBOYCE: If they can spare you a moment, I'd like to make my medical\\r\\nreport.\\r\\nVINA: I think it's time to show the Captain our secret.\\r\\nBOYCE: Their health is excellent. Almost too good.\\r\\nHASKINS: There's a reason for our condition, but we've had some doubt\\r\\nif Earth is ready to learn the secret. Let the girl show you. We'll\\r\\naccept your judgment.\\r\\n(Pike follows Vina up a slope to a ledge by a rock face) \\r\\nVINA: You're tired, but don't worry. You'll feel much better soon.\\r\\nDon't you see it? Here and here.\\r\\nPIKE: I don't understand.\\r\\nVINA: You will. You're a perfect choice. \\r\\n(Vina vanishes, and so do all the survivors and their encampment. A\\r\\ndoor opens in the rock face, Pike is knocked out and taken inside. At\\r\\nthe settlement -)\\r\\nTYLER: Captain! \\r\\n(Everyone rushes over in time to see the door closing in the rock. They\\r\\nfire their phasers at it but it just blasts away the rock covering to\\r\\nshow the metal underneath.) \\r\\nSPOCK: Spock here.\\r\\nONE [OC]: Landing party, come in.\\r\\nSPOCK: There is no survivors' encampment, Number One. This is all some\\r\\nsort of trap. We've lost the Captain. Do you read?\\r\\n\\n[Pike's cage]\\n\\n(Pike wakes to find himself in a cell with a\\r\\ntransparent wall blocking his escape. He tests it's strength, and\\r\\nnotices other similar occupied cells. There's a fanged ape, a giant\\r\\nbird and other scary shadows. The three aliens arrive)\\r\\nPIKE: Can you hear me? My name is Christopher Pike, commander of the\\r\\nspace vehicle Enterprise from a stellar group at the other end of this\\r\\ngalaxy. Our intentions are peaceful. Can you understand me?\\r\\n(the aliens communicate with their minds, not voices)\\r\\nTALOSIAN: It appears, Magistrate, that the intelligence of the specimen\\r\\nis shockingly limited.\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: This is no surprise since his vessel was baited here so\\r\\neasily with a simulated message. As you can read in its thoughts, it is\\r\\nonly now beginning to suspect that the survivors and encampment were a\\r\\nsimple illusion we placed in their minds.\\r\\nPIKE: You're not speaking, yet I can hear you.\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: You will note the confusion as it reads our thought\\r\\ntransmissions.\\r\\nPIKE: All right then, telepathy. You can read my mind. I can read\\r\\nyours. Now, unless you want my ship to consider capturing me an\\r\\nunfriendly act\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: You now see the primitive fear threat reaction. The\\r\\nspecimen is about to boast of his strength, the weaponry of his vessel,\\r\\nand so on. Next, frustrated into a need to display physical prowess,\\r\\nthe creature will throw himself against the transparency.\\r\\nPIKE: If you were in here, wouldn't you test the strength of these\\r\\nwalls, too? There's a way out of any cage, and I'll find it.\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: Despite its frustration, the creature appears more\\r\\nadaptable than our specimens from other planets. We can soon begin the\\r\\nexperiment. \\n[Briefing room]\\n\\nSPOCK: The inhabitants of this planet must live\\r\\ndeep underground, and probably manufacture food and other needs down\\r\\nthere. Our tests indicate the planet surface, without considerably more\\r\\nvegetation or some animals, simply too barren to support life.\\r\\nONE: So we just thought we saw survivors there, Mister Spock.\\r\\nSPOCK: Exactly. An illusion placed in our minds by this planet's\\r\\ninhabitants.\\r\\nBOYCE: It was a perfect illusion. They had us seeing just what we\\r\\nwanted to see, human beings who'd survived with dignity and bravery,\\r\\neverything entirely logical, right down to the building of the camp,\\r\\nthe tattered clothing, everything. Now let's be sure we understand the\\r\\ndanger of this. The inhabitants of this planet can read our minds. They\\r\\ncan create illusions out of a person's own thoughts, memories, and\\r\\nexperiences, even out of a person's own desires. Illusions just as real\\r\\nand solid as this table top and just as impossible to ignore.\\r\\nONE: Any estimate what they might want one of us for? \\r\\nSPOCK: They may simply be studying the Captain, to find out how Earth\\r\\npeople are put together. Or it could be something more. \\r\\nTYLER: Then why aren't we doing anything? That entry may have stood up\\r\\nagainst hand lasers, but we can transmit the ship's power against it.\\r\\nEnough to blast half a continent. \\r\\nSPOCK: Look. Brains three times the size of ours. If we start buzzing\\r\\nabout down there, we're liable to find their mental power is so great\\r\\nthey could reach out and swat this ship as though it were a fly.\\r\\nTYLER: It's Captain Pike they've got. He needs help, and he probably\\r\\nneeds it fast. ONE: Engineering deck will rig to transmit ship's power.\\r\\nWe'll try blasting through that metal.\\r\\n\\n[Talosian monitoring room]\\n\\n(As Pike continues to explore his cell) \\r\\nTALOSIAN: Thousands of us are already probing the creature's thoughts,\\r\\nMagistrate. We find excellent memory capacity.\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: I read most strongly a recent death struggle in which it\\r\\nfought to protect its life. We will begin with this, giving the\\r\\nspecimen something more interesting to protect.\\r\\n\\n[Rigel Seven]\\n\\nVINA: Come on, we must hide ourselves. Come, come.\\r\\nHurry. It's deserted. There'll be weapons and perhaps food.\\r\\nPIKE: This is Rigel Seven.\\r\\nVINA: Please, we must hide ourselves.\\r\\nPIKE: I was in a cage, a cell, in some kind of a zoo. I must still be\\r\\nthere.\\r\\nVINA: Come on.\\r\\nPIKE: They've reached into my mind and taken the memory of somewhere\\r\\nI've been.\\r\\nVINA: The killer!\\r\\nPIKE: It's starting just as it happened two weeks ago. Except for you.\\r\\n\\n[Fortress]\\n\\n(The courtyard is scattered with lances and spears)\\r\\n\\r\\nPIKE: Longer hair, different dress, but it is you, the one the\\r\\nsurvivors called Vina. Or rather the image of Vina. But why you again?\\r\\nWhy didn't they create a different girl? \\r\\n(The killer enters - a big humanoid with shield and axe) \\r\\nVINA: Quick. If you attack while it's not looking.\\r\\nPIKE: But it's only a dream.\\r\\nVINA: You have to kill him as you did here before.\\r\\nPIKE: You can tell my jailers I won't go along with it. I'm not an\\r\\nanimal performing for its supper.\\r\\nVINA: It doesn't matter what you call this, you'll feel it. That's what\\r\\nmatters. You'll feel every moment of whatever happens to you. Please,\\r\\ndon't you know what he'll do to us? \\r\\n(so Pike fights the killer with mace and shield) \\r\\nPIKE: Why would an illusion be frightened? \\r\\nVINA: Because that's the way you imagined me. \\r\\nPIKE: Who are you? You act as if this were really you. \\r\\nVINA: Careful. \\r\\n(Pike and Vina retreat up some stairs. The killer breaks Pike's spear\\r\\nand they throw objects at it. Pike gets knocked down into the\\r\\ncourtyard. The killer grabs Vina and Pike throws a spear into it's\\r\\nback. Then it jumps down and spears itself on a wicked harpoon that\\r\\nPike grabs just in time)\\r\\n\\n[Pike's cell]\\n\\nVINA: It's over. \\r\\n(Vina hugs her hero, then sees the Talosians watching them. The\\r\\nTalosians leave.)\\r\\nPIKE: Why are you here? \\r\\nVINA: To please you. \\r\\nPIKE: Are you real? \\r\\nVINA: As real as you wish. \\r\\nPIKE: No, no. No, that's not an answer. I've never met you before,\\r\\nnever even imagined you.\\r\\nVINA: Perhaps they made me out of dreams you've forgotten.\\r\\nPIKE: What, and dress you in the same metal fabric they wear?\\r\\nVINA: I have to wear something, don't I? I can wear whatever you wish,\\r\\nbe anything you wish.\\r\\nPIKE: So they can see how their specimen performs? They want to see how\\r\\nI react, is that it?\\r\\nVINA: Don't you have a dream, something you've always wanted very badly?\\r\\nPIKE: Or do they do more than just watch me? Do they feel with me, too?\\r\\nVINA: You can have whatever dream you want. I can become anything, any\\r\\nwoman you've ever imagined. You can have anything you want in the whole\\r\\nuniverse. Let me please you.\\r\\nPIKE: Yes. Yes, you can please me. You can tell me about them. Is there\\r\\nany way I can keep them from probing my mind, from using my thoughts\\r\\nagainst me? Does that frighten you? Does that mean there is a way?\\r\\nVINA: You're a fool.\\r\\nPIKE: Since you're not real, there's not much point in continuing this\\r\\nconversation, is there.\\r\\n\\n[Planet surface]\\n\\n(A big laser cannon is aimed at the door in the\\r\\nrock.\\r\\nONE: All circuits engaged, Mister Spock.\\r\\nSPOCK [OC]: Standing by, Number One.\\r\\nONE: Take cover.\\r\\nSPOCK [OC]: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.\\r\\n(The laser cannon blasts away)\\r\\nONE: Increase to full power! Can you give us any more?\\r\\nSPOCK [OC]: Our circuits are beginning to heat. We'll have to cease\\r\\npower.\\r\\nONE: Disengage. The top of that knoll should have been sheared off the\\r\\nfirst second.\\r\\nBOYCE: Maybe it was. It's what I tried to explain in the briefing room.\\r\\nTheir power of illusion is so great, we can't be sure of anything we\\r\\ndo, anything we see.\\r\\n\\n[Pike's cell]\\n\\nVINA: Perhaps if you asked me some questions, I\\r\\ncould answer.\\r\\nPIKE: How far can they control my mind?\\r\\nVINA: If I tell you, then will you pick some dream you've had and let\\r\\nme live it with you?\\r\\nPIKE: Perhaps.\\r\\nVINA: They can't actually make you do anything you don't want to do.\\r\\nPIKE: But they try to trick me with their illusions.\\r\\nVINA: And, they can punish you when you're not co-operative. You'll\\r\\nfind out about that. \\r\\nPIKE: Did they ever live on the surface of this planet? Why did they go\\r\\nunderground?\\r\\nVINA: War, thousands of centuries ago.\\r\\nPIKE: That's why it's so barren up there?\\r\\nVINA; The planet's only now becoming able to support life again.\\r\\nPIKE: So the Talosians who came underground found life limited here and\\r\\nthey concentrated on developing their mental power.\\r\\nVINA: But they found it's a trap. Like a narcotic. Because when dreams\\r\\nbecome more important than reality, you give up travel, building,\\r\\ncreating. You even forget how to repair the machines left behind by\\r\\nyour ancestors. You just sit, living and reliving other lives left\\r\\nbehind in the thought record.\\r\\nPIKE: Or sit probing minds of zoo specimens like me.\\r\\nVINA: You're better than a theatre to them. They create the illusion\\r\\nfor you, they watch you react, feel your emotions. They have a whole\\r\\ncollection of specimens, descendants of life brought back long ago from\\r\\nall over this part of the galaxy.\\r\\nPIKE: Which means they had to have more than one of each animal.\\r\\nVINA: Please.\\r\\nPIKE: They'll need a pair of humans too. Where do they get intend to\\r\\nget the Earth woman?\\r\\nVINA: You said that if I answered questions\\r\\nPIKE: But that was a bargain with something that didn't exist. You said\\r\\nyou weren't real, remember?\\r\\nVINA: I'm a woman as real and as human as you are. We're like Adam and\\r\\nEve. If we. Don't. Please don't punish me! (disappears)\\r\\n(Pike sees the Magistrate walk away) \\r\\n(Pike continues to search the walls for a door when a hatch opens and a\\r\\nglass is placed on the floor)\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: The vial contains a nourishing protein complex.\\r\\nPIKE: Is the keeper actually communicating with one of his animals?\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: If the form and the colour is not appealing, it can appear\\r\\nas any food you wish to visualise.\\r\\nPIKE: And if I prefer\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: To starve? You overlook the unpleasant alternative of\\r\\npunishment.\\r\\n(Pike is surrounded by fire and brimstone, screaming in pain)\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: From a fable you once heard in childhood. You will now\\r\\nconsume the nourishment.\\r\\nPIKE: Why not just put irresistible hunger in my mind? Because you\\r\\ncan't, can you? You do have limitations, don't you?\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: If you continue to disobey, from deeper in your mind, there\\r\\nare things even more unpleasant.\\r\\n(Pike drinks the nourishment then launches himself at the glass wall.\\r\\nThe Magistrate steps back in surprise)\\r\\nPIKE: That's very interesting.\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: Now to the female.\\r\\nPIKE: You were startled. Weren't you reading my mind then?\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: As you've conjectured, an Earth vessel did crash on our\\r\\nplanet, but with only a single survivor.\\r\\nPIKE: No, let's stay on the first subject. All I wanted for that moment\\r\\nwas to get my hands around your neck.\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: We repaired the survivor's injuries and found the species\\r\\ninteresting.\\r\\nPIKE: Do primitive thoughts put up a block you can't read through?\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: It became necessary to attract a mate.\\r\\nPIKE: All right, all right, let's talk about the girl. You seem to be\\r\\ngoing out of your way to make her attractive, to make me feel\\r\\nprotective.\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: This is necessary in order to perpetuate the species.\\r\\nPIKE: It seems more important to you now that I begin to accept her and\\r\\nlike her.\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: We wish our specimens to be happy in their new life.\\r\\nPIKE: Assuming that's a lie, why would you want me attracted to her? So\\r\\nI'll feel love in a husband-wife relationship? That would be necessary\\r\\nonly if you intend to build a family group or perhaps a whole human\\r\\ncommunity.\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: With the female now properly conditioned.\\r\\nPIKE: You mean properly punished! I'm the one who's not co-operating!\\r\\nWhy don't you punish me?\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: First, an emotion of protectiveness. Now one of sympathy.\\r\\nExcellent.\\r\\n\\n[Woodland glade]\\n\\n(A picnic spread on a tartan rug, two horses\\r\\nstanding by, a futuristic city in the distance) \\r\\nVINA: You want some coffee, dear? I left the thermos hooked to my\\r\\nsaddle.\\r\\nPIKE: Tango! You old devil, you. I'm sorry I don't have any sugar.\\r\\nWell, they think of everything, don't they? (feeds lumps to the horse) \\r\\nVINA: Hey, your coffee. Is it good to be home?\\r\\nPIKE: They read our minds very well. Home, anything else I want, if I\\r\\nco-operate, is that it?\\r\\nVINA: Have you forgotten my headaches, darling? I get them when you\\r\\ntalk strangely like this. \\r\\nPIKE: Look, I'm sorry they punish you, but we can't let them \\r\\nVINA: My, it turned out to be a lovely day, didn't it? \\r\\nPIKE: It's funny. It's about twenty four hours ago I was telling the\\r\\nship's doctor how much I wanted something else not very different from\\r\\nwhat we have here. An escape from reality. Life with no frustrations.\\r\\nNo responsibilities. Now that I have it, I understand the doctor's\\r\\nanswer. \\r\\nVINA: I hope you're hungry. These little white sandwiches are your\\r\\nmother's recipe\\r\\nfor chicken tuna. \\r\\nPIKE: You either live life, bruises, skinned knees and all, or you turn\\r\\nyour back on it and start dying. The doctor's going to be happy about\\r\\none part, at least. He said I needed a rest. \\r\\nVINA: This is a lovely place to rest. \\r\\nPIKE: I used to ride through here when I was a kid. It's not as pretty\\r\\nas some of the parkland around the big cities, but. That's Mojave.\\r\\nThat's where I was born. \\r\\nVINA: Is that supposed to be news to your wife? You're home. You can\\r\\neven stay if you want. Wouldn't it be nice showing your children where\\r\\nyou once played? \\r\\nPIKE: These headaches, they'll be hereditary you know. Would you wish\\r\\nthem on a child or a whole group of children? \\r\\nVINA: Foolish. \\r\\nPIKE: Is it? Look, first they made me protect you and then feel\\r\\nsympathy for you. Now we have these familiar surroundings and a\\r\\ncomfortable husband-wife relationship. They don't need all this for\\r\\njust passion. What they're after is respect and mutual dependence. \\r\\nVINA: They say in the olden days all this was a desert. Blowing sand\\r\\nand cactus. \\r\\nPIKE: But we're not here, neither of us. We're in a menagerie, a cage!\\r\\nVINA: No.\\r\\nPIKE; I can't help either one of us if you won't give me a chance. Now,\\r\\nyou told me once they used illusions as a narcotic. They couldn't\\r\\nrepair the machines left by their ancestors. Is that why they want us,\\r\\nto build a colony of slaves?\\r\\nVINA: Stop it. Don't you care what they'll do to us?\\r\\nPIKE: Back in my cage, it seemed for a couple of minutes that our\\r\\nkeeper couldn't read my thoughts. Do emotions like hate, keeping hate\\r\\nin your mind, does that block off our mind from them?\\r\\nVINA: Yes. They can't read through primitive emotions. But you can't\\r\\nkeep it up for long enough. I've tried. They keep at you and at you\\r\\nyear after year, tricking and punishing, and they won. They own me. I\\r\\nknow you must hate me for that.\\r\\nPIKE: Oh, no. I don't hate you. I can guess what it was like.\\r\\nVINA: But that's not enough. Don't you see? They read my thoughts, my\\r\\nfeelings, my dreams of what would be a perfect man. That's why they\\r\\npicked you. I can't help but love you and they expect you to feel the\\r\\nsame way.\\r\\nPIKE: If they can read my mind, then they know I'm attracted to you. \\n[Talosian monitoring room]\\n\\nPIKE [on monitor]: I was from the very first moment\\r\\nI saw you in the survivor's camp. \\r\\nTALOSIAN: A curious species. They have fantasies they hide even from\\r\\nthemselves. \\r\\nVINA [on monitor]: I'm beginning to see why none of this has worked for\\r\\nyou. You've been home, and fighting as on Rigel. That's not new to you,\\r\\neither. A person's strongest dreams are about what he can't do. Yes, a\\r\\nship's captain, always having to be so formal, so decent and honest and\\r\\nproper. You must wonder what it would be like to forget all that.\\r\\n\\n[Open air party]\\n\\n(A band plays, and a green woman dances sensuously)\\r\\nOFFICER: Nice place you have here, Mister Pike.\\r\\n(The dancer is -) \\r\\nPIKE: Vina?\\r\\nORION: Glistening green. Almost like secret dreams a bored ship captain\\r\\nmight have. \\r\\nOFFICER: Funny how they are on this planet. They actually like being\\r\\ntaken advantage of. Suppose you had all of space to choose from, and\\r\\nthis was only one small sample. \\r\\nORION: Wouldn't you say it was worth a man's soul?\\r\\n(Pike gets up and leaves. The door he walks through turns into a rock\\r\\nwall. Then Vina is there, holding a blazing torch)\\r\\n\\n[Transporter room]\\n\\nSPOCK: We've located a magnetic field that seems to\\r\\ncome from their underground generator.\\r\\nGARISON: Could that be an illusion too? \\r\\nONE: Now, you all know the situation. We're hoping to transport down\\r\\ninside the Talosian community.\\r\\nSPOCK: If our measurements and readings are an illusion also, one could\\r\\nfind oneself materialised inside solid rock.\\r\\nONE: Nothing will be said if any volunteer wants to back out.\\r\\n(Pitcairn energises but only Number One and Yeoman Colt dematerialise) \\r\\nSPOCK: The women!\\r\\n\\n[Pike's cage]\\n\\nONE: Captain! Captain.\\r\\nVINA: No! Let me finish!\\r\\nONE: But we were a party of six.\\r\\nCOLT: We were the only ones transported.\\r\\nVINA: It's not fair. You don't need them.\\r\\nPIKE: (grabbing Colt's laser pistol) They don't work.\\r\\nONE: They were fully charged when we left. It's dead. (communicator) I\\r\\ncan't make a signal. What is it?\\r\\nPIKE: Don't say anything. I'm filling my mind with a picture of beating\\r\\ntheir huge, misshapen heads to pulp, thoughts so primitive they black\\r\\nout everything else. I'm filling my mind with hate.\\r\\nVINA: How long can you block your thoughts? A few minutes, an hour? How\\r\\ncan that help?\\r\\nCOLT: Leave him alone.\\r\\nVINA: He doesn't need you. He's already picked me.\\r\\nCOLT: Picked her? For what? I don't understand.\\r\\nVINA: Now, there's a fine choice for intelligent offspring.\\r\\nCOLT: Offspring, as in children?\\r\\nONE: Offspring as in he's Adam. Is that it?\\r\\nVINA: You're no better choice. They'd have more luck crossing him with\\r\\na computer.\\r\\nONE: Well, shall we do a little time computation? There was a Vina\\r\\nlisted on that expedition as an adult crewman. Now, adding eighteen\\r\\nyears to your age then.\\r\\n(The Magistrate approaches the cell)\\r\\nVINA: It's not fair. I did what you asked.\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: Since you resist the present specimen, you now have a\\r\\nselection.\\r\\nPIKE: I'll break out of this zoo somehow and get to you. Is your blood\\r\\nred like ours? I'm going to find out.\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: Each of the two new specimens has qualities in her favour.\\r\\nThe female you call Number One has the superior mind and would produce\\r\\nhighly intelligent children. Although she seems to lack emotion, this\\r\\nis largely a pretence. She has often has fantasies involving you. \\r\\nPIKE: All I want to do is get my hands on you. Can you read these\\r\\nthoughts? Images of hate, killing?\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: The other new arrival has considered you unreachable but\\r\\nnow is realising this has changed. The factors in her favour are youth\\r\\nand strength, plus unusually strong female drives. \\r\\nPIKE: You'll find my thoughts more interesting. Thoughts so primitive\\r\\nyou can't understand. Emotions so ugly\\r\\n(stricken by pain)\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: Wrong thinking is punishable. Right thinking will be as\\r\\nquickly rewarded. You will find it an effective combination. \\r\\n(Magistrate leaves)\\r\\nONE: Captain.\\r\\nPIKE: No. No, don't help me. I have to concentrate. They can't read\\r\\nthrough hate.\\r\\n\\n[Bridge]\\n\\nSPOCK: Address intercraft. \\r\\nGARISON: Open, sir. \\r\\nSPOCK: This is the acting captain speaking. We have no choice now but\\r\\nto consider the safety of this vessel and the remainder of the crew.\\r\\nWe're leaving. All decks prepare for hyperdrive. Time warp factor. \\r\\nTYLER: Mister Spock, the ship's controls have gone dead. \\r\\n(The lights go out) \\r\\nSPOCK: Engine room! \\r\\nGARISON: Open. \\r\\nSPOCK: Mister Spock here. Switch to rockets. We're blasting out. \\r\\nPITCAIRN [OC]: All systems are out, bridge. We've got nothing. \\r\\nTYLER: There's nothing. Every system aboard is fading out.\\r\\n\\n[Pike's cell]\\n\\n (The group are apparently dozing when the\\r\\nMagistrate opens the hatch to get the laser pistols Pike dropped there.\\r\\nHe grabs him and pulls him into the cage, and starts to throttle him)\\r\\nPIKE: Now you hold still, or I'll break your neck.\\r\\nVINA: Don't hurt them. They don't mean to be evil.\\r\\nPIKE: I've had some samples of how good they are.\\r\\n(the Talosian appears to be a vicious monster)\\r\\nPIKE: You stop this illusion, or I'll twist your head off. (it stops)\\r\\nAll right, now you try one more illusion, you try anything at all, and\\r\\nI'll break your neck.\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: Your ship. Release me or we'll destroy it.\\r\\n\\n{Bridge]\\n\\n(The senior officers have taken the navigation\\r\\nconsole apart) \\r\\nSPOCK: Nothing. But for the batteries we'd lose gravitation and oxygen.\\r\\n\\r\\nTYLER: The computers! \\r\\n(The monitor shows a montage of images - space capsules, the Moon, maps\\r\\nof Earth) \\r\\nTYLER: I can't shut it off. It's running through our library. Tapes,\\r\\nmicro-records, everything. It doesn't make sense. \\r\\nSPOCK: Could be we've waited too long. It's collecting all the\\r\\ninformation stored in this fly. They've decided to swat us. \\n[Pike's cell]\\n\\nVINA: He's not bluffing, Captain. With illusion\\r\\nthey can make your crew work the wrong controls or push any button it\\r\\ntakes to destroy your ship.\\r\\nPIKE: I'm going to gamble you're too intelligent to kill for no reason\\r\\nat all. \\r\\n(Pike hands the Magistrate over to Number One and picks up the laser\\r\\npistols, firing them at the glass wall. Then he puts one to the\\r\\nMagistrate's head) \\r\\nPIKE: On the other hand, I've got a reason. I'm willing to bet you've\\r\\ncreated an illusion this laser is empty. I think it just blasted a hole\\r\\nin that window and you're keep us from seeing it. You want me to test\\r\\nmy theory out on your head?\\r\\n(There is a hole in the window) \\r\\nCOLT: Captain. \\r\\n(They all leave through the hole and get into the elevator to the\\r\\nsurface)\\r\\n\\n[Planet surface]\\n\\n(The top of the rocky knoll is split apart) \\r\\nPIKE: Make contact, Number One.\\r\\nONE: They kept us from seeing this, too. We cut through and never knew\\r\\nit. Captain.\\r\\n(The communicator isn't working) \\r\\nMAGISTRATE: As you see, your attempt to escape accomplished nothing.\\r\\nPIKE: I want to contact our ship.\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: You are now on the surface where we wished you to be. With\\r\\nthe female of your choice, you will now begin carefully guided lives.\\r\\nPIKE: And start by burying you?\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: That is your choice. To help you reclaim the planet's\\r\\nsurface, our zoological gardens will furnish a variety of plant life.\\r\\nPIKE: Look, I'll make a deal with you. You and your life for the lives\\r\\nof these two Earth women. \\r\\nMAGISTRATE: Since our lifespan is many times yours, we have time to\\r\\nevolve you into a society trained to serve as artisans, technicians \\r\\nPIKE: Do you understand what I'm saying? You give me proof that our\\r\\nship is all right, send these two back, and I'll stay with Vina.\\r\\n(Number One sets her laser pistol to overload)\\r\\nONE: It's wrong to create a whole race of humans to live as slaves.\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: Is this a deception? Do you intend to destroy yourselves?\\r\\nVINA: What is that?\\r\\nPIKE: The weapon is building up an overload. A force chamber explosion.\\r\\nYou still have time to get underground. Well, go on! (pushes Vina away)\\r\\nJust to show you how primitive humans are, Talosian, you go with her.\\r\\nVINA: If, if you all think it's this important, then I can't go either.\\r\\nI suppose if they have one human being, they might try again. \\r\\n(More Talosians arrive) \\r\\nPIKE: Wait.\\r\\n(Number One turns off the pistol) \\r\\nTALOSIAN: Their method of storing records is crude and consumed much\\r\\ntime. Are you prepared to assimilate it?\\r\\n(The Magistrate nods, and the veins on his head throb) \\r\\nMAGISTRATE: We had not believed this possible. The customs and history\\r\\nof your race show a unique hatred of captivity. Even when it's pleasant\\r\\nand benevolent, you prefer death. This makes you too violent and\\r\\ndangerous a species for our needs.\\r\\nVINA: He means that they can't use you. You're free to go back to the\\r\\nship.\\r\\nPIKE: And that's it? No apologies? You captured one of us, threatened\\r\\nall of us.\\r\\nTALOSIAN: Your unsuitability has condemned the Talosian race to\\r\\neventual death. Is this not sufficient?\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: No other specimen has shown your adaptability. You were our\\r\\nlast hope.\\r\\nPIKE: But wouldn't some form of trade, mutual co-operation? \\r\\nMAGISTRATE: Your race would learn our power of illusion and destroy\\r\\nitself too.\\r\\nONE: Captain, we have transporter control now.\\r\\nPIKE: Let's get back to the ship.\\r\\nVINA: I can't. I can't go with you.\\r\\n\\n[Transporter room]\\n\\nPITCAIRN: Sir, it just came on. We can't shut the\\r\\npower off.\\r\\nSPOCK: Mister Spock here.\\r\\nTYLER [OC]: All power has come on, Mister Spock. The helm is answering\\r\\nto control.\\r\\n(The transporter platforms light up and first Colt, then Number One are\\r\\nbeamed aboard)\\r\\nGARISON: The captain?\\r\\n\\n[Planet surface]\\n\\n(Vina changes into a scarred, misshapen older woman)\\r\\nVINA: You see why I can't go with you.\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: This is the female's true appearance.\\r\\nVINA: They found me in the wreckage, dying. A lump of flesh. They\\r\\nrebuilt me. Everything works. But they had never seen a human. They had\\r\\nno guide for putting me back together.\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: It was necessary to convince you her desire to stay is an\\r\\nhonest one.\\r\\nPIKE: You'll give her back her illusion of beauty? \\r\\nMAGISTRATE: And more. \\r\\n(Beautiful Vina and happy Pike go up the slope and into the elevator) \\r\\nMAGISTRATE: She has an illusion and you have reality. May you find your\\r\\nway as pleasant. \\n[Transporter room]\\n\\nPITCAIRN: Mister Spock, the system is coming on\\r\\nagain. \\r\\n(Pike is beamed aboard) \\r\\nCOLT: What's happened to Vina? \\r\\nONE: Isn't she coming with us?\\r\\nPIKE: No. No, and I agreed with her reasons.\\r\\n\\n[Bridge]\\n\\n(Pike, Number One and Spock enter) \\r\\nBOYCE: Hold on a minute. \\r\\nPIKE: Oh, I feel fine, just fine. \\r\\nBOYCE: You look a hundred percent better. \\r\\nPIKE: You recommended a rest, a change of pace, didn't you? I've even\\r\\nbeen home. Does that make you happy? \\r\\n(He bumps into Colt again) \\r\\nPIKE: Yeoman. \\r\\nCOLT: Yes, sir. \\r\\nPIKE: I thought I told you that when I'm on the bridge I \\r\\n(She hands him a clip-board stuffed with papers for his signature) \\r\\nPIKE: Oh. Oh yes. The reports. Thank you. \\r\\nCOLT: Sir, I was wondering. Just curious. Who would have been Eve? \\r\\nONE: Yeoman! You've delivered your report. \\r\\nCOLT: Yes, ma'am. Yes, sir. \\r\\nTYLER: Eve, sir? Yes, sir. \\r\\nBOYCE: Eve as in Adam? \\r\\nPIKE: As in all ship's doctors are dirty old men. What are we running\\r\\nhere, a cadet ship, Number One?

       "'Will You Take My Hand? Will You Take My Hand? Stardate: 2257Original Airdate: 11 Feb 2018 KLINGON: We have acquired the target. (Our viewpoint moves in from the Klingon fleet past Jupiter and Mars to a blue planet with a single large moon, a spacedock and plenty of small satellites.) BURNHAM: On the eve of battle, on a cold and windless night, an old general turned to a young soldier. \"Tomorrow,\" said the master, \"you will know fear.\" The young soldier, who had not yet experienced the agony of war, looked at the general with quizzical eyes. \"How will I know fear if I do not know what it looks like?\" The general replied, \"You will know fear because it speaks very fast and it speaks very loud.\" GEORGIOU: Status, helm? DETMER: Bearing 94 mark 21, 12 light-years from Klingon homeworld GEORGIOU: Do not show respect by referring to that green dot as homeworld. Klingons are animals, and they do not have homes. Call it Qo\\'noS, or the enemy planet. Ops? OWOSEKUN: Shields holding at 100%. Our scans show GEORGIOU: I have little interest in what we are scanning. I care what is scanning us. Communications? BRYCE: Discovery is running dark, Captain. GEORGIOU: My favorite way to run. BURNHAM: If that is how fear acts, recognizing it is easy. But as the young soldier considered the general\\'s advice, she asked the question facing us now. \"Once I know fear, how do I defeat it?\" SARU: Specialist, I would appreciate your help with a glitch in the optical-data network. (Burnham joins Saru.) SARU: (sotto) She does not embody Federation ideals, and we are supposed to follow her orders? BURNHAM: (sotto) The Federation put her here. GEORGIOU: Burnham. I did not give you permission to leave your station. (Burnham goes back across the bridge.) GEORGIOU: what is wrong? Are you scared, Number One? Where I am from, there is a saying. Scared Kelpien makes for tough Kelpien. Have you gotten tough since we served together on the Shenzhou, Mister Saru? SARU: Affirmative, Captain. Very tough. So much so that many find me simply unpalatable. GEORGIOU: Hmm. I do not know about that. BURNHAM: Where are you from, Captain? That saying about Kelpiens is so apt, having experienced it firsthand. I wonder where it originated. GEORGIOU: do not be silly, Michael. You know I grew up in Malaysia. BURNHAM: But where, exactly? I went there with you once, but I can not remember the name. GEORGIOU: Pulau Langkawi. BURNHAM: Right. Those beautiful beaches. GEORGIOU: Indeed. let us take a walk. GEORGIOU: Try to expose me again and I will lock you in the brig. BURNHAM: If Starfleet recruited a Terran to lead the mission, they are desperate. GEORGIOU: The Federation had a problem. I offered them a solution in exchange for my freedom. And what is so bad about desperation? You were desperate when you begged me to reveal how my Empire beat the Klingons. You instigate valiantly, then second-guess. I have now read about your actions on the eve of the war. You know your problem? No follow-through. You should have killed my counterpart in her Ready room, attacked the Klingons, and then been a hero. BURNHAM: (grabbing Georgiou\\'s arm) Tell me the real plan. GEORGIOU: Never do that again. Your Federation is losing. (Burnham let us go) The Klingon armada is already headed toward your homeworld. My knowledge is giving you a fighting chance. Are you with me or against me? BURNHAM: With you, Captain. L\\'RELL: You? How? Our Lord pierced your heart. House T\\'Kuvma feasted on your flesh. GEORGIOU: You have the wrong Philippa Georgiou. L\\'RELL: Either way, I can tell you require seasoning. (Georgiou activates a hologram of Qo\\'noS.) L\\'RELL: My home. GEORGIOU: There are seven chimneys on Qo\\'noS which lead into a dormant volcano system. Of these, which is the best for a landing party to reach on foot? L\\'RELL: I will tell you nothing. This war ends when we crush you, united under T\\'Kuvma\\'s call. BURNHAM: This war may rage on, but your war, your great dream of Klingon unification? it is already lost. L\\'RELL: (Klingonaase) Go to hell, very small human. GEORGIOU: You both talk too much. (Georgiou activates L\\'Rell\\'s restraints and lowers the forcefield so she can attack her.) BURNHAM: No! GEORGIOU: Reactivate containment field. Control to my voice. (hits L\\'Rell) Tell me where my party should land. (More punches and kicks) Where? L\\'RELL: You have already lost. BURNHAM: Enough! there is another way. GEORGIOU: Admiral Cornwell briefed me on this half-breed. I can see, from a strategic standpoint, its value as a weapon, but as it is Klingon, it has been neutered. It is benign, useless to them, yet tarnished to the Federation, so what good is it to either side? BURNHAM: He has access to the Klingon\\'s memories. GEORGIOU: All I can see is a who-knows-what playing with a string. TYLER: This is a bowline, it does not run. It does not slip. it is the first thing I learned as a kid that made me me. It ties me to my past, who I am. Voq\\'s life, his memories, they are here too. Always with me. I am willing to share his knowledge. Not for you, but for Starfleet. Do you want my help or not? GEORGIOU: What do you know about the surface of Qo\\'noS? BURNHAM: The plan is to use a drone with rock-penetrating surveillance systems to map the surface and identify military targets, in preparation for a future full-scale attack. Unfortunately, the cave Discovery will hide in is not connected to the planet\\'s dormant volcanoes. In order for the mapping drone to work, it has to be introduced into one of these. As you are aware, information regarding Qo\\'noS is virtually non-existent. we are depending on black market surveys acquired by the Vulcans over a century ago. TYLER: This chimney\\'s in the High Council chamber of the First City. All high-bred arrogance, that place. This one\\'s now flooded by the River Skral. Here, this is your best bet. The safest access point for the drone. Centuries ago, when the caldera was active, these vents were shrines. Live sacrifices were thrown in to honour Molor. When Kahless defeated Molor, those temples were abandoned, built over. The ones that remained were shielded to make them impossible to find with sensors. you will have to transport down there and do the legwork yourself. BURNHAM: what is there now? TYLER: The land was given to the Orions, who built an embassy outpost over the ruins. GEORGIOU: In my world, the Orions are delinquents, pirates, slave traders. BURNHAM: it is not much different in ours. GEORGIOU: Excellent. He will accompany us and help us sniff out what we are after. Will that be a problem? BURNHAM: No. TYLER: No. Captain. GEORGIOU: I looked over the crew manifest. there is somebody else I want with us. Enter. (door opens) I am so pleased to see you, Tilly. TILLY: Thank you. I have heard and read so much about you. Michael can attest, I am always asking about Captain Georgiou. GEORGIOU: Seeing your face reminds me of the great fun the two of us had, subjugating the Betazoids, Wiping out Mintaka III. TILLY: Oh, she is not TYLER: No. TILLY: So she is from BURNHAM: Mmm. TILLY: you are the Terran Emperor. (Tilly makes the salute.) BURNHAM: do not do that. GEORGIOU: You look so much like her. Younger, maybe. But all that killing ages a person. (she touches Tilly\\'s auburn curls) These are hideous, of course. TILLY: I know. What is happening? BURNHAM: She requested you, for the landing party. TILLY: Oh. But just so you are clear, I am not the same person I was in your universe. GEORGIOU: do not be so sure, Killy. You will have the honour of carrying the mapping drone. Go to quarters. Dress as lowlifes. We need items to trade so as to seem legitimate. Gabriel must have found something interesting lying around in this universe. TYLER: You going to be okay down there? BURNHAM: You do not need to worry about me. SARU: Ready, Lieutenant Stamets? STAMETS: First an alternate universe, now a Klingon cave on a hundred-year-old map. Ready as can be, Mister Saru. SARU: Black alert. To Qo\\'noS, please. AIRIAM: Aye, Captain. COMPUTER: Black alert. Black alert. (Discovery jumps into a cavern.) OWOSEKUN: Shields holding. DETMER: Stabiliser beams are compensating for the planet\\'s gravitational pull. STAMETS: Am I good or what? SARU: We are aboard and steady. SARU: You are clear to transport. GEORGIOU: Energise. TILLY: Not a lot of humans around here. GEORGIOU: Except the dregs from our race. TYLER: Exactly. The Orions here are not likely to trust us or give up any information. (Pasts stalls selling various types of food, and entrances to places of ahem physical pleasures.) ORION WOMAN: Keep walking, Federation. No one wants you here. GEORGIOU: Tilly. TILLY: (gun to head) Insult her again, and your nose is going to be able to sniff the back of your head. GEORGIOU: we are here to make a deal. Show her the stash. Tell her what she is looking at. TILLY: Nausicaan disruptor pistols. Latest spec. Paralithium cell with beam and a pulse firing mode. Polyalloy casings, making it all but invisible to security screeners. GEORGIOU: 2,000 darseks. ORION WOMAN: let us see what else you got. TILLY: All this arms dealing has my appetite up. Anyone else hungry? Anyone? Michael? STALLHOLDER: Greetings. TILLY: Two, please. BURNHAM: What is that? TILLY: I have no idea. I am not actually hungry. I wanted to talk to you. BURNHAM: I intuited. TILLY: Do you have any idea what she might be up to? BURNHAM: No. All we can do is watch her like a hawk, and make sure she stays on mission. TILLY: I er, I realise how hard this must be for you, but I got your back. BURNHAM: Thank you. GEORGIOU: What is that? TILLY: Delicious. TYLER: it is a space whale. TILLY: Gormagander? (food drops from her open mouth) GEORGIOU: Enough distractions. we are not here for bread and circuses. (Three patrons are thrown out of somewhere.) SHAVO: (in Orion) Get out! All of you. GEORGIOU: On second thought, the circus is where we will start. (Music, exotic dancers of all genders.) TILLY: So, what should we GEORGIOU: Shh! I knew your whole universe could not be boring. (hands a device to Tyler) Use this. we will be more effective if we split up. Buy information. Whatever gets us to that shrine. (Tyler and Burnham leave. A male dancer comes over to Georgiou and Tyler.) GEORGIOU: Hmm. How much for a little me time? SHAVO: Over there. GEORGIOU: Bring your friend. TILLY: No, no, that, very generous. I think I will... I am just going to stay out here. GEORGIOU: she is not for you. Guard the drone. TYLER: Maybe these guys can lead us to the shrine. BURNHAM: If they will talk to us. TYLER: The game is called t\\'Sang. It translates to obliterate them. BURNHAM: You know how to play? TYLER: I think I do. And I think I am good at it. I mean, Voq was good at it. He was a decent gambler. He felt the numbers always fell his way, as if the universe was making up for his bad luck with everything else. BURNHAM: Like what? TYLER: He was born with a rare mutation that made his skin translucent white. The others considered him a freak of nature. (Dialogue now in Klingonaase.) KLINGON: What are you doing here, human? Spying for the Federation? TYLER: No, I am looking to take a few hundred darseks from losers like you. let us begin your humiliation. KLINGON: Do you have cash to play, little boy with a big mouth? TYLER: Out of my way. CROUPIER: Place your bets. TYLER: Croupier. CROUPIER: Red. Red. TYLER: New player goes first. Two! Two! Victory! Destroy him! Two! Victory! Owned! (The Klingons laugh with Tyler.) (An Orion - who once was the child Balok - inhales some smoke then waves Tilly over.) ORION: Join me? TILLY: Oh, thank you. ORION: Smoke? TILLY: Oh, that, that is so sweet. No, thank you. I have, er, I have a very narrow esophagus. it is strange but true, so that is bad for that. I am not... I am not trying to be rude ORION: Get her out. TILLY: You know what? I would love some. Just a little bit. ORION: Inhale. TILLY: Do you think, do you think I got (Tilly passes out.) TYLER: I got nothing. None of them know about an ancient shrine. BURNHAM: You won everyone over quickly. TYLER: A human speaking Klingon is amusing to them. Might as well be a dog on waterskis. BURNHAM: Is that an old Klingon saying? TYLER: No, I... I just made it up. I like to waterski. BURNHAM: Yeah, you have a boat. I remember. TYLER: You raced out of there pretty quick. You all right? BURNHAM: I never told you about my parents. What happened to them. TYLER: No. I mean, I have heard things. I never wanted to push. BURNHAM: They were stationed at a human-Vulcan science outpost at Doctari Alpha. My mom and dad had planned a family vacation to Mars, but I begged them to stay for three more days so I could witness a nearby star go supernova. Then the Klingons attacked. My dad tried to barricade the kitchen door while my mom hid me in a cabinet. And I could not see, but I could hear everything. They killed my dad first. That was quick. They took longer with my mom. And when it was over, they sat down at our table. Ate dinner. Our dinner. And they were talking and laughing. And just now, all that laughter... TYLER: How could you not hate them? And me, for what I have become? BURNHAM: It would be so much simpler if I could. I look around here and I just I see people living their lives. Maybe it is not normal to us, but in their own way, ordinary. The Emperor was wrong. This is a home. And if we give the Federation targets to attack, it will not ever be the same. TYLER: I can see both sides. Literally. The side I have chosen is where you stand, where it is possible to feel compassion and sympathy for your enemy. But I can guarantee no Klingon ever felt that way toward you. BURNHAM: You did. TYLER: You see that? Pouring an extra drink. Setting it on fire. that is a step specific to the followers of Molor. there is a decent chance they know about that shrine. (He goes out to talk to the two Klingons.) (Georgiou appears satiated.) SHAVO: Did you enjoy yourself? GEORGIOU: Did you? SHAVO: I learned so many new things. We should not charge you. SHAVA: But we have to charge you. GEORGIOU: Perhaps if you teach me something new, it will be fair trade. (She punches Shavo and turns her weapon on Shava.) GEORGIOU: Where is the shrine of Molor? (Meanwhile, the Orion is trying to cut through the metal fastening the case with the drone in it to Tilly\\'s wrist. She wakes.) TILLY: Hey, stop! Hey, stop. Shame on you. ORION: You were asleep. I am Orion. TILLY: What did, erh, we inhale? My mouth tastes like sulphur and... and ash. ORION: Volcanic vapour, straight from the source. TILLY: Yeah, but not really, right? because all the volcanoes here are extinct. ORION: Oh, no. they are alive. TILLY: Then how is the drone going to get down there? The heat will destroy it. Give me that. (She takes his thermal knife and opens the case herself.) TILLY: Oh, shit. That is not a drone. Tilly to Burnham. BURNHAM: Go ahead, Tilly. TILLY: First of all, so, I am very high, er, but you need to listen to me. TILLY: There are active volcanoes right beneath us right now TILLY: And the drone, also, that is not a drone. it is a, it is a like a hydro bomb. We keep them on the Discovery so we can reco GEORGIOU: What did you say about a hydro bomb? (Georgiou punches Tilly in the face, knocking her out.) BURNHAM: Tilly? Cadet, respond. TYLER: I know where to find the shrine. what is wrong? BURNHAM: it is Tilly. TYLER: A hydro bomb? What kind of damage can it do? TILLY: Detonate it into an active volcanic system, it is just... apocalyptic. BURNHAM: A phreatic eruption. Water flashes into steam and triggers a massive explosion. TILLY: Landmasses directly over the reaction centre will be vaporised. BURNHAM: Oh TILLY: Ash will fill the atmosphere. Within weeks, Qo\\'noS will be uninhabitable. BURNHAM: This was the plan all along. Burnham to Discovery. SARU: Go ahead, Burnham. BURNHAM: Georgiou is about to instigate a catastrophic natural disaster on Qo\\'noS. She may already be in the shrine. Can you get a transporter lock on her? SARU: Affirmative. However, beaming her out is not an option. (Georgiou has dropped the bomb down the well.) SARU: The shrine\\'s shields make it unsafe for biological transport. BURNHAM: What about the bomb? Can you get the bomb? SARU: We are too late. The signal\\'s fading. We must contact Starfleet. BURNHAM: Saru, I think she is following Starfleet\\'s orders. I need to talk to Admiral Cornwell. (After a simulation of Qo\\'noS turning into a ball of dust.) BURNHAM: Is this how Starfleet wins the war? Genocide? CORNWELL: You want to do this here? Fine. Terms of atrocity are convenient after the fact. The Klingons are on the verge of wiping out the Federation. BURNHAM: Yes. But ask yourself. Why did you put this mission in the hands of a Terran and why the secrecy? it is because you know it is not who we are. CORNWELL: It very soon will be. We do not have the luxury of principles. BURNHAM: That is all we have, Admiral. A year ago I stood alone. I believed that our survival was more important than our principles. I was wrong. Do we need a mutiny today to prove who we are? SARU: We are Starfleet. (The bridge crew stands in support.) CORNWELL: What is it you are suggesting? BURNHAM: Change of plans. GEORGIOU: Really? Says who? BURNHAM: Deactivate the detonator, Philippa. Your freedom is still granted. here is the proof. GEORGIOU: You talked them out of it, did not you? BURNHAM: Of planetary slaughter? Yes. GEORGIOU: Oh, do not be so dramatic. When I did this in my universe, it did not wipe out the Klingons. A decent number should be able to save themselves. Plus, they will have an advantage. No Terran ships firing on them as they try to escape. BURNHAM: Turn it off. GEORGIOU: Has it ever occurred to you that I was doing this for you? By ending the war, I would set you free from the guilt and pain you carry because of it. BURNHAM: Not buying it. GEORGIOU: Worth a try. BURNHAM: You really are nothing like my Georgiou, are you? GEORGIOU: No. And I never have been. she is dead, Michael. There are no second chances. BURNHAM: No, I suppose not. GEORGIOU: I do like you. Why not join me? The bomb is in position. We have the detonator. Starfleet and Klingon alike will be at our mercy. BURNHAM: I had much the same thought. Give it to me. (Georgiou aims her weapon at Burnham.) BURNHAM: Take your freedom in exchange for the detonator, or try to escape my ship and its crew and be hunted by the Federation for the rest of your days. GEORGIOU: You think your Federation scares me? BURNHAM: Not particularly. But the only way you are going to get past me is to kill me. So you will have to watch me die again. And did I mention being hunted for the rest of your days? (Powers down weapon.) GEORGIOU: The detonator is coded to my bioprint. Would you like it recoded to yours? BURNHAM: Not to mine, no. (into communicator) All clear. (Tyler and L\\'Rell enter.) L\\'RELL: What is this? BURNHAM: This is the place the Federation crushed the Klingons. we have planted a bomb in the heart of your homeworld. Qo\\'noS will be destroyed. L\\'RELL: You bring me here to gloat? BURNHAM: No. To offer you an alternative. (Georgiou hands over the detonator.) BURNHAM: Klingons respond to strength. Use the fate of Qo\\'noS to bend them to your will. Preserve your civilisation rather than watch it be destroyed. L\\'RELL: But I am no one. TYLER: You once told Voq that you did not want the mantle of leadership. (in Klingonaase) I am the Torchbearer. The one who lights the way for the leader. Voq has always believed in you, L\\'Rell. (English) it is time for you to leave the shadows. GEORGIOU: I will leave you to it, then. BURNHAM: Be good, Philippa. GEORGIOU: Or you will come for me? BURNHAM: Make sure I do not have to. TYLER: Isik for your thoughts. BURNHAM: I always wanted to find out what one was. I never did. TYLER: L\\'Rell has arranged for a transport to a Makai ship. BURNHAM: they are in for a surprise. TYLER: it is not the human way to make a message heard, but it is the Klingon way. I am going with her. it is true, what the Emperor said. I am no good for either side. I... But maybe I can be good for both. I have never been great at goodbyes. BURNHAM: Neither am I. I have had too many of them. TYLER: Michael. In spite of everything that happened to you, your capacity to love literally saved my life. I am going to miss looking at you. BURNHAM: I see you, Ash, in your eyes. Only you. (They hug then kiss.) TYLER: Thank... thank you. (Tyler leaves. Burnham has the bowline knot in her hand. Tyler and L\\'Rell are beamed away.) BURNHAM: Burnham to Discovery. One to transport. L\\'RELL: T\\'Kuvma knew that the most powerful Empire was a united Empire. Twenty four Houses working as one. He believed the quickest way to bring us together was war with the Federation. But in this fight we have lost our way A new leader is needed to fulfill my Lord\\'s vision. I am that leader. (Laughter.) L\\'RELL: In my hand, I hold the fate of the Klingon homeworld. Of the Klingon Empire itself. We are proud. We are honourable. And we will be one again. You will throw down your arms or you will suffer the consequences. The choice is yours. The reunification of our race begins now. (The Klingon fleet leaves Earth space.) BURNHAM: Earth, Andor, Tellar, Vulcan. Every planet of the Federation has made the odyssey out of darkness into light. So too have the Klingons. The war is over. There were triumphs. Victories of spirit. Courage beyond reason. But make no mistake. These were bleak times. Times we cannot repeat. Times we cannot forget. (In the rain.) AMANDA: Isik for your thoughts. BURNHAM: what is an isik, anyway? AMANDA: Oh, I do not know. it is something my mother used to say to me. BURNHAM: Thank you for coming. I am glad to see you. AMANDA: Is everything okay? BURNHAM: When I was growing up, you told me not to forget my humanity. I did not know what that meant. I did not how to do it. I did not even know why I would want to. I get it now. So thank you, for not giving up on me. AMANDA: that is what mothers do. SAREK: Michael. BURNHAM: Father. SAREK: What the Federation chose to do on Qo\\'noS was unprincipled, and I had a part in it. BURNHAM: The Klingons made it clear they would fight us to extinction. You were desperate to save us. I know the feeling all too well. SAREK: And yet, you were able to find another way. I am not alone in finding your commitment to Starfleet\\'s ideals commendable. I asked if I may give it to you. Your record has been expunged, your pardon by the president of the Federation is official. (He pins an insignia onto her uniform.) SAREK: Commander Burnham, the Federation is as grateful to you as I am to my daughter. Your mother will stay in Paris for a few days. I will travel with Discovery to Vulcan. you are picking up your new captain there. BURNHAM: I am glad we will be making that journey together. (Medals have been awarded.) BURNHAM: We are no longer on the eve of battle. Even so, I come to ask myself the same question that young soldier asked the general all those years ago. \"How do I defeat fear?\" The general\\'s answer? The only way to defeat fear is to tell it \"no.\" No, we will not take shortcuts on the path to righteousness. No, we will not break the rules that protect us from our basest instincts. No, we will not allow desperation to destroy moral authority. I am guilty of all these things. Some say that in life, there are no second chances. Experience tells me that this is true. But we can only look forward. We have to be torchbearers, casting the light so we may see our path to lasting peace. We will continue exploring, discovering new worlds, new civilisations. Yes, that is the United Federation of Planets. CORNWELL: Today, we honor Ensign Sylvia Tilly. Accepted into Starfleet Command Training Program. BURNHAM: Yes. That is Starfleet. CORNWELL: Lieutenant Commander Paul Stamets. Medical Officer Hugh Culber. BURNHAM: Yes, that is who we are. CORNWELL: Commander Saru. First Kelpien to receive the Medal of Honour. BURNHAM: And who we will always be. (The audience applauds and cheers.) TILLY: Never been to Vulcan before. BURNHAM: Well, if there is time, I will show you around. it is strange that we are not jumping to Vulcan. STAMETS: Well, Starfleet has committed to finding a non-human interface. Until that happens, I am happy to go the old-fashioned way. TILLY: Captain on the bridge. SARU: Acting Captain. Please take your stations. You may consult with Science Officer Burnham later. SAREK: Thank you, Mister Saru, for permitting me this small indulgence. I never tire of seeing home. SARU: Of course. Lieutenant Detmer, have we cleared the Sol system? DETMER: Yes, Captain. SARU: Set course for Vulcan, and engage at maximum warp. DETMER: Aye, sir. (They jump to warp. An incoming transmission, Federation: Encrypted priority one distress is detected.) BRUCE: Incoming transmission. SARU: From whom? BRYCE: I am having trouble identifying it. But it is a priority-one distress call. SARU: Identify the source, please. BRYCE: I am getting a Federation ID code. it is choppy. Trying to clean it up, sir. (NCC-17...) SARU: Helm, slow us down. DETMER: Dropping us out of warp now, sir. SARU: This is Captain Saru of the Federation Starship Discovery. Please identify yourselves. BRYCE: Hail\\'s from Captain Pike, sir. BURNHAM: it is the USS Enterprise. (The two spaceships hang saucer to saucer, and the proper Star Trek theme plays.)'"

      " Detonate it into an active volcanic system, it is just... apocalyptic. \n",

      " Go ahead, Burnham. \n",
      "BURNHAM\n",
      " Georgiou is about to instigate a catastrophic natural disaster on QonoS. She may already be in the shrine. Can you get a transporter lock on her? \n",
      "SARU\n",
      " Affirmative. However, beaming her out is not an option. (Georgiou has dropped the bomb down the well.) \n",

      " We are too late. The signals fading. We must contact Starfleet. \n",
      "BURNHAM\n",
      " Saru, I think she is following Starfleets orders. I need to talk to Admiral Cornwell. (After a simulation of QonoS turning into a ball of dust.) \n",
      "BURNHAM\n",
      " Is this how Starfleet wins the war? Genocide? \n",
      "CORNWELL\n",
      " You want to do this here? Fine. Terms of atrocity are convenient after the fact. The Klingons are on the verge of wiping out the Federation. \n",
      "BURNHAM\n",
      " Yes. But ask yourself. Why did you put this mission in the hands of a Terran and why the secrecy? it is because you know it is not who we are. \n",
      "CORNWELL\n",
      " It very soon will be. We do not have the luxury of principles. \n",
      "BURNHAM\n",
      " That is all we have, Admiral. A year ago I stood alone. I believed that our survival was more important than our principles. I was wrong. Do we need a mutiny today to prove who we are? \n",

      "BURNHAM\n",
      " Of planetary slaughter? Yes. \n",
      "GEORGIOU\n",
      " Oh, do not be so dramatic. When I did this in my universe, it did not wipe out the Klingons. A decent number should be able to save themselves. Plus, they will have an advantage. No Terran ships firing on them as they try to escape. \n",

      " Turn it off. \n",

      " No, I suppose not. \n",
      "GEORGIOU\n",
      " I do like you. Why not join me? The bomb is in position. We have the detonator. Starfleet and Klingon alike will be at our mercy. \n",
      "BURNHAM\n",
      " I had much the same thought. Give it to me. (Georgiou aims her weapon at Burnham.) \n",
      "BURNHAM\n",

      "GEORGIOU\n",
      " You think your Federation scares me? \n",
      "BURNHAM\n",
      " Not particularly. But the only way you are going to get past me is to kill me. So you will have to watch me die again. And did I mention being hunted for the rest of your days? (Powers down weapon.) \n",
      "GEORGIOU\n",
      " The detonator is coded to my bioprint. Would you like it recoded to yours? \n",

      "GEORGIOU\n",

The only way to defeat fear is to tell it \"no.\" No, we will not take shortcuts on the path to righteousness. No, we will not break the rules that protect us from our basest instincts. No, we will not allow desperation to destroy moral authority. I am guilty of all these things. Some say that in life, there are no second chances. Experience tells me that this is true. But we can only look forward. We have to be torchbearers, casting the light so we may see our path to lasting peace. We will continue exploring, discovering new worlds, new civilisations.

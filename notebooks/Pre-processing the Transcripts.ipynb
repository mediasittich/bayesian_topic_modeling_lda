Definitely something out there,\\r\\nCaptain, headed this way. \\r\\nTYLER: It could be these meteorites. \\r\\nONE: No, it's something else. There's still something out there. \\r\\nTYLER: It's coming at the speed of light, collision course. The\\r\\nmeteorite beam has not deflected it, Captain.\\r\\nONE: Evasive manoeuvres, sir?\\r\\nPIKE: Steady as we go.\\r\\nGARISON: It's a radio wave, sir. We're passing through an old-style\\r\\ndistress signal.\\r\\nPIKE: They were keyed to cause interference and attract attention this\\r\\nway.\\r\\nGARISON: A ship in trouble making a forced landing, sir. That's it. No\\r\\nother message.\\r\\nTYLER: I have a fix. It comes from the Talos star group.\\r\\nONE: We've no ships or Earth colonies that far out.\\r\\nSPOCK: Their call letters check with a survey expedition. SS Columbia.\\r\\nIt disappeared in that region approximately eighteen years ago.\\r\\nTYLER: It would take that long for a radio beam to travel from there to\\r\\nhere.\\r\\nSPOCK: Records show the Talos group has never been explored. Solar\\r\\nsystem similar to Earth, eleven planets. Number four seems to be Class\\r\\nM, oxygen atmosphere.\\r\\nONE: Then they could still be alive, even after eighteen years.\\r\\nPIKE: If they survived the crash.\\r\\nSPOCK: We aren't going to go, to be certain?\\r\\nPIKE: Not without any indication of survivors, no. Continue to the Vega\\r\\nColony and take care of our own sick and injured first. You have the\\r\\nhelm. Maintain present course.\\r\\nONE: Yes, sir.\\r\\n\\n[Pike's quarters]\\n\\nBOYCE [OC}: Boyce here.\\r\\nPIKE: Drop by my cabin, Doctor. (Boyce enters with bag) What's that? I\\r\\ndidn't say there's anything wrong with me.\\r\\nBOYCE: I understand we picked up a distress signal.\\r\\nPIKE: That's right. Unless we get anything more positive on it, it\\r\\nseems to me the condition of our own crew takes precedent. I'd like to\\r\\nlog the ship's doctor's opinion, too.\\r\\nBOYCE: Oh, I concur with yours, definitely.\\r\\nPIKE: Good. I'm glad you do, because we're going to stop first at the\\r\\nVega Colony and replace anybody who needs hospitalisation and also.\\r\\nWhat the devil are you putting in there, ice?\\r\\nBOYCE: Who wants a warm martini?\\r\\nPIKE: What makes you think I need one?\\r\\nBOYCE: Sometimes a man'll tell his bartender things he'll never tell\\r\\nhis doctor. What's been on your mind, Chris, the fight on Rigel Seven?\\r\\nPIKE: Shouldn't it be? My own yeoman and two others dead, seven\\r\\ninjured.\\r\\nBOYCE: Was there anything you personally could have done to prevent it?\\r\\nPIKE: Oh, I should have smelled trouble when I saw the swords and the\\r\\narmour. Instead of that, I let myself get trapped in that deserted\\r\\nfortress and attacked by one of their warriors.\\r\\nBOYCE: Chris, you set standards for yourself no one could meet. You\\r\\ntreat everyone on board like a human being except yourself, and now\\r\\nyou're tired and you\\r\\nPIKE: You bet I'm tired. You bet. I'm tired of being responsible for\\r\\ntwo hundred and three lives. I'm tired of deciding which mission is too\\r\\nrisky and which isn't, and who's going on the landing party and who\\r\\ndoesn't, and who lives and who dies. Boy, I've had it, Phil.\\r\\nBOYCE: To the point of finally taking my advice, a rest leave?\\r\\nPIKE: To the point of considering resigning.\\r\\nBOYCE: And do what?\\r\\nPIKE: Well, for one thing, go home. Nice little town with fifty miles\\r\\nof parkland around it. Remember I told you I had two horses, and we\\r\\nused to take some food and ride out all day.\\r\\nBOYCE: Ah, that sounds exciting. Ride out with a picnic lunch every day.\\r\\nPIKE: I said that's one place I might go. I might go into business on\\r\\nRegulus or on the Orion colony.\\r\\nBOYCE: You, an Orion trader, dealing in green animal women, slaves?\\r\\nPIKE: The point is this isn't the only life available. There's a whole\\r\\ngalaxy of things to choose from.\\r\\nBOYCE: Not for you. A man either lives life as it happens to him, meets\\r\\nit head-on, and licks it, or he turns his back on it and starts to\\r\\nwither away.\\r\\nPIKE: Now you're beginning to talk like a doctor, bartender.\\r\\nBOYCE: Take your choice. We both get the same two kinds of customers.\\r\\nThe living and the dying.\\r\\nSPOCK [on monitor]: Mister Spock here. We're intercepting a follow-up\\r\\nmessage, sir. There are crash survivors on Talos.\\r\\n\\n[Bridge]\\n\\nGARISON: (reads) Eleven survivors from crash.\\r\\nGravity and oxygen within limits. Food and water obtainable, but\\r\\nunless. The message faded at that point, sir.\\r\\nPIKE: Address intercraft.\\r\\nTYLER: System open.\\r\\nPIKE: This is the captain. Our destination is the Talos star group. Our\\r\\ntime warp, factor seven.\\r\\nTYLER: Course computed and on the screen.\\r\\nONE: All decks have acknowledged, sir.\\r\\nPIKE : Engage.\\r\\nTYLER: On course, sir. \\r\\n(Colt enters. Pike turns around and bumps into her) \\r\\nPIKE: Yeoman. \\r\\nCOLT: Yes, sir. \\r\\nPIKE: I thought I told you that when I'm on the bridge \\r\\nCOLT: But you wanted the reports by oh five hundred. It's oh five\\r\\nhundred now, sir. \\r\\nPIKE: Oh, I see. Thank you. \\r\\nONE: She's replacing your former yeoman, sir. \\r\\nPIKE: She does a good job, all right. It's just that I can't get used\\r\\nto having a woman on the bridge. No offence, Lieutenant. You're\\r\\ndifferent, of course. \\r\\n(The Enterprise arrives at a planet) \\r\\nTYLER: We've settled into orbit, sir.\\r\\nGEOLOGIST: Geological lab report complete, Captain.\\r\\nSPOCK: Preliminary lab survey ready, sir.\\r\\nPIKE: Spectography?\\r\\nGEOLOGIST: Our reading shows an oxygen nitrogen atmosphere, sir, heavy\\r\\nwith inert elements but well within safety limits.\\r\\nPIKE: Gravity?\\r\\nGEOLOGIST: Zero point nine of Earth.\\r\\nTYLER: Captain? Reflections, sir, from the planet's surface. As I read\\r\\nit, they polarise out as rounded metal bits. Could be parts of a\\r\\nspaceship hull.\\r\\nPIKE: Prep a landing party of six. You feel up to it?\\r\\nSPOCK: Yes, sir.\\r\\nTYLER: Yes, sir. \\r\\nPIKE: Sorry, Number One. With little information on this planet, we'll\\r\\nhave to leave the ship's most experienced officer here covering us.\\r\\nONE: Of course, sir.\\r\\n\\n[Transporter room]\\n\\nPIKE: There's no indication of problems down there,\\r\\nbut let's not take chances.\\r\\nPITCAIRN: Yes, sir. There's a canyon to the left. We can set you there\\r\\ncompletely unobserved.\\r\\n\\n[Planet surface]\\n\\n(the group explores until they find a rough\\r\\nsettlement) \\r\\nGARISON: Sir.\\r\\nOLD MAN: They're men. They're humans.\\r\\nPIKE: Captain Christopher Pike, United Space Ship Enterprise.\\r\\nHASKINS: Doctor Theodore Haskins, American Continent lnstitute.\\r\\nSURVIVOR: Is Earth all right?\\r\\nPIKE: The same old Earth, and you'll see it very soon.\\r\\nTYLER: And you won't believe how fast you can get back. Well the time\\r\\nbarrier's been broken. Our new ships can\\r\\n(He's struck dumb by the sight of a lovely young woman) \\r\\nHASKINS: This is Vina. Her parents are dead. She was born almost as we\\r\\ncrashed.\\r\\n(The reunion is being watched on another screen, by three people with\\r\\nbig bald heads) \\r\\nPIKE: (as the survivors pack up the settlement) Enterprise.\\r\\nONE [OC]: Landing party, come in.\\r\\nPIKE: We'll begin transporting the survivors and their effects up to\\r\\nyou very shortly.\\r\\nONE [OC]: Quarters are being prepared, sir. Have I permission to send\\r\\nout scouting and scientific parties now?\\r\\nPIKE: That's affirmative on the\\r\\nVINA: You appear to be healthy and intelligent, Captain. A prime\\r\\nspecimen.\\r\\nONE [OC]: I didn't get that last message, Captain.\\r\\nPIKE: Er, affirmative on request. Landing party out.\\r\\nHASKINS: You must forgive her choice of words, Captain. She's lived her\\r\\nwhole life with a collection of aging scientists.\\r\\nBOYCE: If they can spare you a moment, I'd like to make my medical\\r\\nreport.\\r\\nVINA: I think it's time to show the Captain our secret.\\r\\nBOYCE: Their health is excellent. Almost too good.\\r\\nHASKINS: There's a reason for our condition, but we've had some doubt\\r\\nif Earth is ready to learn the secret. Let the girl show you. We'll\\r\\naccept your judgment.\\r\\n(Pike follows Vina up a slope to a ledge by a rock face) \\r\\nVINA: You're tired, but don't worry. You'll feel much better soon.\\r\\nDon't you see it? Here and here.\\r\\nPIKE: I don't understand.\\r\\nVINA: You will. You're a perfect choice. \\r\\n(Vina vanishes, and so do all the survivors and their encampment. A\\r\\ndoor opens in the rock face, Pike is knocked out and taken inside. At\\r\\nthe settlement -)\\r\\nTYLER: Captain! \\r\\n(Everyone rushes over in time to see the door closing in the rock. They\\r\\nfire their phasers at it but it just blasts away the rock covering to\\r\\nshow the metal underneath.) \\r\\nSPOCK: Spock here.\\r\\nONE [OC]: Landing party, come in.\\r\\nSPOCK: There is no survivors' encampment, Number One. This is all some\\r\\nsort of trap. We've lost the Captain. Do you read?\\r\\n\\n[Pike's cage]\\n\\n(Pike wakes to find himself in a cell with a\\r\\ntransparent wall blocking his escape. He tests it's strength, and\\r\\nnotices other similar occupied cells. There's a fanged ape, a giant\\r\\nbird and other scary shadows. The three aliens arrive)\\r\\nPIKE: Can you hear me? My name is Christopher Pike, commander of the\\r\\nspace vehicle Enterprise from a stellar group at the other end of this\\r\\ngalaxy. Our intentions are peaceful. Can you understand me?\\r\\n(the aliens communicate with their minds, not voices)\\r\\nTALOSIAN: It appears, Magistrate, that the intelligence of the specimen\\r\\nis shockingly limited.\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: This is no surprise since his vessel was baited here so\\r\\neasily with a simulated message. As you can read in its thoughts, it is\\r\\nonly now beginning to suspect that the survivors and encampment were a\\r\\nsimple illusion we placed in their minds.\\r\\nPIKE: You're not speaking, yet I can hear you.\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: You will note the confusion as it reads our thought\\r\\ntransmissions.\\r\\nPIKE: All right then, telepathy. You can read my mind. I can read\\r\\nyours. Now, unless you want my ship to consider capturing me an\\r\\nunfriendly act\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: You now see the primitive fear threat reaction. The\\r\\nspecimen is about to boast of his strength, the weaponry of his vessel,\\r\\nand so on. Next, frustrated into a need to display physical prowess,\\r\\nthe creature will throw himself against the transparency.\\r\\nPIKE: If you were in here, wouldn't you test the strength of these\\r\\nwalls, too? There's a way out of any cage, and I'll find it.\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: Despite its frustration, the creature appears more\\r\\nadaptable than our specimens from other planets. We can soon begin the\\r\\nexperiment. \\n[Briefing room]\\n\\nSPOCK: The inhabitants of this planet must live\\r\\ndeep underground, and probably manufacture food and other needs down\\r\\nthere. Our tests indicate the planet surface, without considerably more\\r\\nvegetation or some animals, simply too barren to support life.\\r\\nONE: So we just thought we saw survivors there, Mister Spock.\\r\\nSPOCK: Exactly. An illusion placed in our minds by this planet's\\r\\ninhabitants.\\r\\nBOYCE: It was a perfect illusion. They had us seeing just what we\\r\\nwanted to see, human beings who'd survived with dignity and bravery,\\r\\neverything entirely logical, right down to the building of the camp,\\r\\nthe tattered clothing, everything. Now let's be sure we understand the\\r\\ndanger of this. The inhabitants of this planet can read our minds. They\\r\\ncan create illusions out of a person's own thoughts, memories, and\\r\\nexperiences, even out of a person's own desires. Illusions just as real\\r\\nand solid as this table top and just as impossible to ignore.\\r\\nONE: Any estimate what they might want one of us for? \\r\\nSPOCK: They may simply be studying the Captain, to find out how Earth\\r\\npeople are put together. Or it could be something more. \\r\\nTYLER: Then why aren't we doing anything? That entry may have stood up\\r\\nagainst hand lasers, but we can transmit the ship's power against it.\\r\\nEnough to blast half a continent. \\r\\nSPOCK: Look. Brains three times the size of ours. If we start buzzing\\r\\nabout down there, we're liable to find their mental power is so great\\r\\nthey could reach out and swat this ship as though it were a fly.\\r\\nTYLER: It's Captain Pike they've got. He needs help, and he probably\\r\\nneeds it fast. ONE: Engineering deck will rig to transmit ship's power.\\r\\nWe'll try blasting through that metal.\\r\\n\\n[Talosian monitoring room]\\n\\n(As Pike continues to explore his cell) \\r\\nTALOSIAN: Thousands of us are already probing the creature's thoughts,\\r\\nMagistrate. We find excellent memory capacity.\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: I read most strongly a recent death struggle in which it\\r\\nfought to protect its life. We will begin with this, giving the\\r\\nspecimen something more interesting to protect.\\r\\n\\n[Rigel Seven]\\n\\nVINA: Come on, we must hide ourselves. Come, come.\\r\\nHurry. It's deserted. There'll be weapons and perhaps food.\\r\\nPIKE: This is Rigel Seven.\\r\\nVINA: Please, we must hide ourselves.\\r\\nPIKE: I was in a cage, a cell, in some kind of a zoo. I must still be\\r\\nthere.\\r\\nVINA: Come on.\\r\\nPIKE: They've reached into my mind and taken the memory of somewhere\\r\\nI've been.\\r\\nVINA: The killer!\\r\\nPIKE: It's starting just as it happened two weeks ago. Except for you.\\r\\n\\n[Fortress]\\n\\n(The courtyard is scattered with lances and spears)\\r\\n\\r\\nPIKE: Longer hair, different dress, but it is you, the one the\\r\\nsurvivors called Vina. Or rather the image of Vina. But why you again?\\r\\nWhy didn't they create a different girl? \\r\\n(The killer enters - a big humanoid with shield and axe) \\r\\nVINA: Quick. If you attack while it's not looking.\\r\\nPIKE: But it's only a dream.\\r\\nVINA: You have to kill him as you did here before.\\r\\nPIKE: You can tell my jailers I won't go along with it. I'm not an\\r\\nanimal performing for its supper.\\r\\nVINA: It doesn't matter what you call this, you'll feel it. That's what\\r\\nmatters. You'll feel every moment of whatever happens to you. Please,\\r\\ndon't you know what he'll do to us? \\r\\n(so Pike fights the killer with mace and shield) \\r\\nPIKE: Why would an illusion be frightened? \\r\\nVINA: Because that's the way you imagined me. \\r\\nPIKE: Who are you? You act as if this were really you. \\r\\nVINA: Careful. \\r\\n(Pike and Vina retreat up some stairs. The killer breaks Pike's spear\\r\\nand they throw objects at it. Pike gets knocked down into the\\r\\ncourtyard. The killer grabs Vina and Pike throws a spear into it's\\r\\nback. Then it jumps down and spears itself on a wicked harpoon that\\r\\nPike grabs just in time)\\r\\n\\n[Pike's cell]\\n\\nVINA: It's over. \\r\\n(Vina hugs her hero, then sees the Talosians watching them. The\\r\\nTalosians leave.)\\r\\nPIKE: Why are you here? \\r\\nVINA: To please you. \\r\\nPIKE: Are you real? \\r\\nVINA: As real as you wish. \\r\\nPIKE: No, no. No, that's not an answer. I've never met you before,\\r\\nnever even imagined you.\\r\\nVINA: Perhaps they made me out of dreams you've forgotten.\\r\\nPIKE: What, and dress you in the same metal fabric they wear?\\r\\nVINA: I have to wear something, don't I? I can wear whatever you wish,\\r\\nbe anything you wish.\\r\\nPIKE: So they can see how their specimen performs? They want to see how\\r\\nI react, is that it?\\r\\nVINA: Don't you have a dream, something you've always wanted very badly?\\r\\nPIKE: Or do they do more than just watch me? Do they feel with me, too?\\r\\nVINA: You can have whatever dream you want. I can become anything, any\\r\\nwoman you've ever imagined. You can have anything you want in the whole\\r\\nuniverse. Let me please you.\\r\\nPIKE: Yes. Yes, you can please me. You can tell me about them. Is there\\r\\nany way I can keep them from probing my mind, from using my thoughts\\r\\nagainst me? Does that frighten you? Does that mean there is a way?\\r\\nVINA: You're a fool.\\r\\nPIKE: Since you're not real, there's not much point in continuing this\\r\\nconversation, is there.\\r\\n\\n[Planet surface]\\n\\n(A big laser cannon is aimed at the door in the\\r\\nrock.\\r\\nONE: All circuits engaged, Mister Spock.\\r\\nSPOCK [OC]: Standing by, Number One.\\r\\nONE: Take cover.\\r\\nSPOCK [OC]: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.\\r\\n(The laser cannon blasts away)\\r\\nONE: Increase to full power! Can you give us any more?\\r\\nSPOCK [OC]: Our circuits are beginning to heat. We'll have to cease\\r\\npower.\\r\\nONE: Disengage. The top of that knoll should have been sheared off the\\r\\nfirst second.\\r\\nBOYCE: Maybe it was. It's what I tried to explain in the briefing room.\\r\\nTheir power of illusion is so great, we can't be sure of anything we\\r\\ndo, anything we see.\\r\\n\\n[Pike's cell]\\n\\nVINA: Perhaps if you asked me some questions, I\\r\\ncould answer.\\r\\nPIKE: How far can they control my mind?\\r\\nVINA: If I tell you, then will you pick some dream you've had and let\\r\\nme live it with you?\\r\\nPIKE: Perhaps.\\r\\nVINA: They can't actually make you do anything you don't want to do.\\r\\nPIKE: But they try to trick me with their illusions.\\r\\nVINA: And, they can punish you when you're not co-operative. You'll\\r\\nfind out about that. \\r\\nPIKE: Did they ever live on the surface of this planet? Why did they go\\r\\nunderground?\\r\\nVINA: War, thousands of centuries ago.\\r\\nPIKE: That's why it's so barren up there?\\r\\nVINA; The planet's only now becoming able to support life again.\\r\\nPIKE: So the Talosians who came underground found life limited here and\\r\\nthey concentrated on developing their mental power.\\r\\nVINA: But they found it's a trap. Like a narcotic. Because when dreams\\r\\nbecome more important than reality, you give up travel, building,\\r\\ncreating. You even forget how to repair the machines left behind by\\r\\nyour ancestors. You just sit, living and reliving other lives left\\r\\nbehind in the thought record.\\r\\nPIKE: Or sit probing minds of zoo specimens like me.\\r\\nVINA: You're better than a theatre to them. They create the illusion\\r\\nfor you, they watch you react, feel your emotions. They have a whole\\r\\ncollection of specimens, descendants of life brought back long ago from\\r\\nall over this part of the galaxy.\\r\\nPIKE: Which means they had to have more than one of each animal.\\r\\nVINA: Please.\\r\\nPIKE: They'll need a pair of humans too. Where do they get intend to\\r\\nget the Earth woman?\\r\\nVINA: You said that if I answered questions\\r\\nPIKE: But that was a bargain with something that didn't exist. You said\\r\\nyou weren't real, remember?\\r\\nVINA: I'm a woman as real and as human as you are. We're like Adam and\\r\\nEve. If we. Don't. Please don't punish me! (disappears)\\r\\n(Pike sees the Magistrate walk away) \\r\\n(Pike continues to search the walls for a door when a hatch opens and a\\r\\nglass is placed on the floor)\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: The vial contains a nourishing protein complex.\\r\\nPIKE: Is the keeper actually communicating with one of his animals?\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: If the form and the colour is not appealing, it can appear\\r\\nas any food you wish to visualise.\\r\\nPIKE: And if I prefer\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: To starve? You overlook the unpleasant alternative of\\r\\npunishment.\\r\\n(Pike is surrounded by fire and brimstone, screaming in pain)\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: From a fable you once heard in childhood. You will now\\r\\nconsume the nourishment.\\r\\nPIKE: Why not just put irresistible hunger in my mind? Because you\\r\\ncan't, can you? You do have limitations, don't you?\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: If you continue to disobey, from deeper in your mind, there\\r\\nare things even more unpleasant.\\r\\n(Pike drinks the nourishment then launches himself at the glass wall.\\r\\nThe Magistrate steps back in surprise)\\r\\nPIKE: That's very interesting.\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: Now to the female.\\r\\nPIKE: You were startled. Weren't you reading my mind then?\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: As you've conjectured, an Earth vessel did crash on our\\r\\nplanet, but with only a single survivor.\\r\\nPIKE: No, let's stay on the first subject. All I wanted for that moment\\r\\nwas to get my hands around your neck.\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: We repaired the survivor's injuries and found the species\\r\\ninteresting.\\r\\nPIKE: Do primitive thoughts put up a block you can't read through?\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: It became necessary to attract a mate.\\r\\nPIKE: All right, all right, let's talk about the girl. You seem to be\\r\\ngoing out of your way to make her attractive, to make me feel\\r\\nprotective.\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: This is necessary in order to perpetuate the species.\\r\\nPIKE: It seems more important to you now that I begin to accept her and\\r\\nlike her.\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: We wish our specimens to be happy in their new life.\\r\\nPIKE: Assuming that's a lie, why would you want me attracted to her? So\\r\\nI'll feel love in a husband-wife relationship? That would be necessary\\r\\nonly if you intend to build a family group or perhaps a whole human\\r\\ncommunity.\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: With the female now properly conditioned.\\r\\nPIKE: You mean properly punished! I'm the one who's not co-operating!\\r\\nWhy don't you punish me?\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: First, an emotion of protectiveness. Now one of sympathy.\\r\\nExcellent.\\r\\n\\n[Woodland glade]\\n\\n(A picnic spread on a tartan rug, two horses\\r\\nstanding by, a futuristic city in the distance) \\r\\nVINA: You want some coffee, dear? I left the thermos hooked to my\\r\\nsaddle.\\r\\nPIKE: Tango! You old devil, you. I'm sorry I don't have any sugar.\\r\\nWell, they think of everything, don't they? (feeds lumps to the horse) \\r\\nVINA: Hey, your coffee. Is it good to be home?\\r\\nPIKE: They read our minds very well. Home, anything else I want, if I\\r\\nco-operate, is that it?\\r\\nVINA: Have you forgotten my headaches, darling? I get them when you\\r\\ntalk strangely like this. \\r\\nPIKE: Look, I'm sorry they punish you, but we can't let them \\r\\nVINA: My, it turned out to be a lovely day, didn't it? \\r\\nPIKE: It's funny. It's about twenty four hours ago I was telling the\\r\\nship's doctor how much I wanted something else not very different from\\r\\nwhat we have here. An escape from reality. Life with no frustrations.\\r\\nNo responsibilities. Now that I have it, I understand the doctor's\\r\\nanswer. \\r\\nVINA: I hope you're hungry. These little white sandwiches are your\\r\\nmother's recipe\\r\\nfor chicken tuna. \\r\\nPIKE: You either live life, bruises, skinned knees and all, or you turn\\r\\nyour back on it and start dying. The doctor's going to be happy about\\r\\none part, at least. He said I needed a rest. \\r\\nVINA: This is a lovely place to rest. \\r\\nPIKE: I used to ride through here when I was a kid. It's not as pretty\\r\\nas some of the parkland around the big cities, but. That's Mojave.\\r\\nThat's where I was born. \\r\\nVINA: Is that supposed to be news to your wife? You're home. You can\\r\\neven stay if you want. Wouldn't it be nice showing your children where\\r\\nyou once played? \\r\\nPIKE: These headaches, they'll be hereditary you know. Would you wish\\r\\nthem on a child or a whole group of children? \\r\\nVINA: Foolish. \\r\\nPIKE: Is it? Look, first they made me protect you and then feel\\r\\nsympathy for you. Now we have these familiar surroundings and a\\r\\ncomfortable husband-wife relationship. They don't need all this for\\r\\njust passion. What they're after is respect and mutual dependence. \\r\\nVINA: They say in the olden days all this was a desert. Blowing sand\\r\\nand cactus. \\r\\nPIKE: But we're not here, neither of us. We're in a menagerie, a cage!\\r\\nVINA: No.\\r\\nPIKE; I can't help either one of us if you won't give me a chance. Now,\\r\\nyou told me once they used illusions as a narcotic. They couldn't\\r\\nrepair the machines left by their ancestors. Is that why they want us,\\r\\nto build a colony of slaves?\\r\\nVINA: Stop it. Don't you care what they'll do to us?\\r\\nPIKE: Back in my cage, it seemed for a couple of minutes that our\\r\\nkeeper couldn't read my thoughts. Do emotions like hate, keeping hate\\r\\nin your mind, does that block off our mind from them?\\r\\nVINA: Yes. They can't read through primitive emotions. But you can't\\r\\nkeep it up for long enough. I've tried. They keep at you and at you\\r\\nyear after year, tricking and punishing, and they won. They own me. I\\r\\nknow you must hate me for that.\\r\\nPIKE: Oh, no. I don't hate you. I can guess what it was like.\\r\\nVINA: But that's not enough. Don't you see? They read my thoughts, my\\r\\nfeelings, my dreams of what would be a perfect man. That's why they\\r\\npicked you. I can't help but love you and they expect you to feel the\\r\\nsame way.\\r\\nPIKE: If they can read my mind, then they know I'm attracted to you. \\n[Talosian monitoring room]\\n\\nPIKE [on monitor]: I was from the very first moment\\r\\nI saw you in the survivor's camp. \\r\\nTALOSIAN: A curious species. They have fantasies they hide even from\\r\\nthemselves. \\r\\nVINA [on monitor]: I'm beginning to see why none of this has worked for\\r\\nyou. You've been home, and fighting as on Rigel. That's not new to you,\\r\\neither. A person's strongest dreams are about what he can't do. Yes, a\\r\\nship's captain, always having to be so formal, so decent and honest and\\r\\nproper. You must wonder what it would be like to forget all that.\\r\\n\\n[Open air party]\\n\\n(A band plays, and a green woman dances sensuously)\\r\\nOFFICER: Nice place you have here, Mister Pike.\\r\\n(The dancer is -) \\r\\nPIKE: Vina?\\r\\nORION: Glistening green. Almost like secret dreams a bored ship captain\\r\\nmight have. \\r\\nOFFICER: Funny how they are on this planet. They actually like being\\r\\ntaken advantage of. Suppose you had all of space to choose from, and\\r\\nthis was only one small sample. \\r\\nORION: Wouldn't you say it was worth a man's soul?\\r\\n(Pike gets up and leaves. The door he walks through turns into a rock\\r\\nwall. Then Vina is there, holding a blazing torch)\\r\\n\\n[Transporter room]\\n\\nSPOCK: We've located a magnetic field that seems to\\r\\ncome from their underground generator.\\r\\nGARISON: Could that be an illusion too? \\r\\nONE: Now, you all know the situation. We're hoping to transport down\\r\\ninside the Talosian community.\\r\\nSPOCK: If our measurements and readings are an illusion also, one could\\r\\nfind oneself materialised inside solid rock.\\r\\nONE: Nothing will be said if any volunteer wants to back out.\\r\\n(Pitcairn energises but only Number One and Yeoman Colt dematerialise) \\r\\nSPOCK: The women!\\r\\n\\n[Pike's cage]\\n\\nONE: Captain! Captain.\\r\\nVINA: No! Let me finish!\\r\\nONE: But we were a party of six.\\r\\nCOLT: We were the only ones transported.\\r\\nVINA: It's not fair. You don't need them.\\r\\nPIKE: (grabbing Colt's laser pistol) They don't work.\\r\\nONE: They were fully charged when we left. It's dead. (communicator) I\\r\\ncan't make a signal. What is it?\\r\\nPIKE: Don't say anything. I'm filling my mind with a picture of beating\\r\\ntheir huge, misshapen heads to pulp, thoughts so primitive they black\\r\\nout everything else. I'm filling my mind with hate.\\r\\nVINA: How long can you block your thoughts? A few minutes, an hour? How\\r\\ncan that help?\\r\\nCOLT: Leave him alone.\\r\\nVINA: He doesn't need you. He's already picked me.\\r\\nCOLT: Picked her? For what? I don't understand.\\r\\nVINA: Now, there's a fine choice for intelligent offspring.\\r\\nCOLT: Offspring, as in children?\\r\\nONE: Offspring as in he's Adam. Is that it?\\r\\nVINA: You're no better choice. They'd have more luck crossing him with\\r\\na computer.\\r\\nONE: Well, shall we do a little time computation? There was a Vina\\r\\nlisted on that expedition as an adult crewman. Now, adding eighteen\\r\\nyears to your age then.\\r\\n(The Magistrate approaches the cell)\\r\\nVINA: It's not fair. I did what you asked.\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: Since you resist the present specimen, you now have a\\r\\nselection.\\r\\nPIKE: I'll break out of this zoo somehow and get to you. Is your blood\\r\\nred like ours? I'm going to find out.\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: Each of the two new specimens has qualities in her favour.\\r\\nThe female you call Number One has the superior mind and would produce\\r\\nhighly intelligent children. Although she seems to lack emotion, this\\r\\nis largely a pretence. She has often has fantasies involving you. \\r\\nPIKE: All I want to do is get my hands on you. Can you read these\\r\\nthoughts? Images of hate, killing?\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: The other new arrival has considered you unreachable but\\r\\nnow is realising this has changed. The factors in her favour are youth\\r\\nand strength, plus unusually strong female drives. \\r\\nPIKE: You'll find my thoughts more interesting. Thoughts so primitive\\r\\nyou can't understand. Emotions so ugly\\r\\n(stricken by pain)\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: Wrong thinking is punishable. Right thinking will be as\\r\\nquickly rewarded. You will find it an effective combination. \\r\\n(Magistrate leaves)\\r\\nONE: Captain.\\r\\nPIKE: No. No, don't help me. I have to concentrate. They can't read\\r\\nthrough hate.\\r\\n\\n[Bridge]\\n\\nSPOCK: Address intercraft. \\r\\nGARISON: Open, sir. \\r\\nSPOCK: This is the acting captain speaking. We have no choice now but\\r\\nto consider the safety of this vessel and the remainder of the crew.\\r\\nWe're leaving. All decks prepare for hyperdrive. Time warp factor. \\r\\nTYLER: Mister Spock, the ship's controls have gone dead. \\r\\n(The lights go out) \\r\\nSPOCK: Engine room! \\r\\nGARISON: Open. \\r\\nSPOCK: Mister Spock here. Switch to rockets. We're blasting out. \\r\\nPITCAIRN [OC]: All systems are out, bridge. We've got nothing. \\r\\nTYLER: There's nothing. Every system aboard is fading out.\\r\\n\\n[Pike's cell]\\n\\n (The group are apparently dozing when the\\r\\nMagistrate opens the hatch to get the laser pistols Pike dropped there.\\r\\nHe grabs him and pulls him into the cage, and starts to throttle him)\\r\\nPIKE: Now you hold still, or I'll break your neck.\\r\\nVINA: Don't hurt them. They don't mean to be evil.\\r\\nPIKE: I've had some samples of how good they are.\\r\\n(the Talosian appears to be a vicious monster)\\r\\nPIKE: You stop this illusion, or I'll twist your head off. (it stops)\\r\\nAll right, now you try one more illusion, you try anything at all, and\\r\\nI'll break your neck.\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: Your ship. Release me or we'll destroy it.\\r\\n\\n{Bridge]\\n\\n(The senior officers have taken the navigation\\r\\nconsole apart) \\r\\nSPOCK: Nothing. But for the batteries we'd lose gravitation and oxygen.\\r\\n\\r\\nTYLER: The computers! \\r\\n(The monitor shows a montage of images - space capsules, the Moon, maps\\r\\nof Earth) \\r\\nTYLER: I can't shut it off. It's running through our library. Tapes,\\r\\nmicro-records, everything. It doesn't make sense. \\r\\nSPOCK: Could be we've waited too long. It's collecting all the\\r\\ninformation stored in this fly. They've decided to swat us. \\n[Pike's cell]\\n\\nVINA: He's not bluffing, Captain. With illusion\\r\\nthey can make your crew work the wrong controls or push any button it\\r\\ntakes to destroy your ship.\\r\\nPIKE: I'm going to gamble you're too intelligent to kill for no reason\\r\\nat all. \\r\\n(Pike hands the Magistrate over to Number One and picks up the laser\\r\\npistols, firing them at the glass wall. Then he puts one to the\\r\\nMagistrate's head) \\r\\nPIKE: On the other hand, I've got a reason. I'm willing to bet you've\\r\\ncreated an illusion this laser is empty. I think it just blasted a hole\\r\\nin that window and you're keep us from seeing it. You want me to test\\r\\nmy theory out on your head?\\r\\n(There is a hole in the window) \\r\\nCOLT: Captain. \\r\\n(They all leave through the hole and get into the elevator to the\\r\\nsurface)\\r\\n\\n[Planet surface]\\n\\n(The top of the rocky knoll is split apart) \\r\\nPIKE: Make contact, Number One.\\r\\nONE: They kept us from seeing this, too. We cut through and never knew\\r\\nit. Captain.\\r\\n(The communicator isn't working) \\r\\nMAGISTRATE: As you see, your attempt to escape accomplished nothing.\\r\\nPIKE: I want to contact our ship.\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: You are now on the surface where we wished you to be. With\\r\\nthe female of your choice, you will now begin carefully guided lives.\\r\\nPIKE: And start by burying you?\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: That is your choice. To help you reclaim the planet's\\r\\nsurface, our zoological gardens will furnish a variety of plant life.\\r\\nPIKE: Look, I'll make a deal with you. You and your life for the lives\\r\\nof these two Earth women. \\r\\nMAGISTRATE: Since our lifespan is many times yours, we have time to\\r\\nevolve you into a society trained to serve as artisans, technicians \\r\\nPIKE: Do you understand what I'm saying? You give me proof that our\\r\\nship is all right, send these two back, and I'll stay with Vina.\\r\\n(Number One sets her laser pistol to overload)\\r\\nONE: It's wrong to create a whole race of humans to live as slaves.\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: Is this a deception? Do you intend to destroy yourselves?\\r\\nVINA: What is that?\\r\\nPIKE: The weapon is building up an overload. A force chamber explosion.\\r\\nYou still have time to get underground. Well, go on! (pushes Vina away)\\r\\nJust to show you how primitive humans are, Talosian, you go with her.\\r\\nVINA: If, if you all think it's this important, then I can't go either.\\r\\nI suppose if they have one human being, they might try again. \\r\\n(More Talosians arrive) \\r\\nPIKE: Wait.\\r\\n(Number One turns off the pistol) \\r\\nTALOSIAN: Their method of storing records is crude and consumed much\\r\\ntime. Are you prepared to assimilate it?\\r\\n(The Magistrate nods, and the veins on his head throb) \\r\\nMAGISTRATE: We had not believed this possible. The customs and history\\r\\nof your race show a unique hatred of captivity. Even when it's pleasant\\r\\nand benevolent, you prefer death. This makes you too violent and\\r\\ndangerous a species for our needs.\\r\\nVINA: He means that they can't use you. You're free to go back to the\\r\\nship.\\r\\nPIKE: And that's it? No apologies? You captured one of us, threatened\\r\\nall of us.\\r\\nTALOSIAN: Your unsuitability has condemned the Talosian race to\\r\\neventual death. Is this not sufficient?\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: No other specimen has shown your adaptability. You were our\\r\\nlast hope.\\r\\nPIKE: But wouldn't some form of trade, mutual co-operation? \\r\\nMAGISTRATE: Your race would learn our power of illusion and destroy\\r\\nitself too.\\r\\nONE: Captain, we have transporter control now.\\r\\nPIKE: Let's get back to the ship.\\r\\nVINA: I can't. I can't go with you.\\r\\n\\n[Transporter room]\\n\\nPITCAIRN: Sir, it just came on. We can't shut the\\r\\npower off.\\r\\nSPOCK: Mister Spock here.\\r\\nTYLER [OC]: All power has come on, Mister Spock. The helm is answering\\r\\nto control.\\r\\n(The transporter platforms light up and first Colt, then Number One are\\r\\nbeamed aboard)\\r\\nGARISON: The captain?\\r\\n\\n[Planet surface]\\n\\n(Vina changes into a scarred, misshapen older woman)\\r\\nVINA: You see why I can't go with you.\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: This is the female's true appearance.\\r\\nVINA: They found me in the wreckage, dying. A lump of flesh. They\\r\\nrebuilt me. Everything works. But they had never seen a human. They had\\r\\nno guide for putting me back together.\\r\\nMAGISTRATE: It was necessary to convince you her desire to stay is an\\r\\nhonest one.\\r\\nPIKE: You'll give her back her illusion of beauty? \\r\\nMAGISTRATE: And more. \\r\\n(Beautiful Vina and happy Pike go up the slope and into the elevator) \\r\\nMAGISTRATE: She has an illusion and you have reality. May you find your\\r\\nway as pleasant. \\n[Transporter room]\\n\\nPITCAIRN: Mister Spock, the system is coming on\\r\\nagain. \\r\\n(Pike is beamed aboard) \\r\\nCOLT: What's happened to Vina? \\r\\nONE: Isn't she coming with us?\\r\\nPIKE: No. No, and I agreed with her reasons.\\r\\n\\n[Bridge]\\n\\n(Pike, Number One and Spock enter) \\r\\nBOYCE: Hold on a minute. \\r\\nPIKE: Oh, I feel fine, just fine. \\r\\nBOYCE: You look a hundred percent better. \\r\\nPIKE: You recommended a rest, a change of pace, didn't you? I've even\\r\\nbeen home. Does that make you happy? \\r\\n(He bumps into Colt again) \\r\\nPIKE: Yeoman. \\r\\nCOLT: Yes, sir. \\r\\nPIKE: I thought I told you that when I'm on the bridge I \\r\\n(She hands him a clip-board stuffed with papers for his signature) \\r\\nPIKE: Oh. Oh yes. The reports. Thank you. \\r\\nCOLT: Sir, I was wondering. Just curious. Who would have been Eve? \\r\\nONE: Yeoman! You've delivered your report. \\r\\nCOLT: Yes, ma'am. Yes, sir. \\r\\nTYLER: Eve, sir? Yes, sir. \\r\\nBOYCE: Eve as in Adam? \\r\\nPIKE: As in all ship's doctors are dirty old men. What are we running\\r\\nhere, a cadet ship, Number One?

       "\"Choose Your Pain Choose Your Pain Stardate: December, 2256Original Airdate: 15 Oct 2017 (We tour the Discovery, deserted of crew, until we come to Engineering, where Burnham is looking at herself in the cell, attached to the nav-comp and surrounded by spores. She initiates the drive and her other self screams. She joins in, then wakes up. Tilly is snoring.) BURNHAM: Doctor Culber, I have been studying the creature since it came on board. it is incredibly regenerative, but with each jump Discovery makes, it cries out. And the last 48 hours, it seems sluggish, depressed. CULBER: We do not know if it experiences stress or pain like we do. BURNHAM: You think I am anthropomorphising. CULBER: You discovered how to use the Tardigrade for navigation. A victory that maybe is not a victory anymore, given the creature's deteriorating condition. Let me run some tests. BURNHAM: Thank you. LORCA: In less than three weeks, the Discovery has prevented the destruction of the dilithium mines at Corvan 2, broken the Klingon supply line at Benzar, and routed an attack through the Ophiucus system. CORNWELL: The reason you have been brought here today is it has become increasingly imperative that we duplicate Discovery's spore-drive technology, and get it into as many Starfleet vessels as possible. LORCA: To that end, I ordered Lieutenant Stamets to release the schematics of our propulsion system immediately after our first successful jump. CORNWELL: Our new classified facility in Jefferson, Iowa received them and is building units according to those specs. We need more Tardigrades to ensure safe, accurate navigation. Every ship, every starbase, every colony is on the hunt for these creatures. In the meantime, we want Discovery to dial back on its missions. LORCA: No, hold on a second. CORNWELL: There is concern at the highest levels of leadership about taxing our prime asset. LORCA: Discovery should be out there, winning battles. CORNWALL: We believe the enemy may have identified Discovery as our secret weapon. You are hereby ordered to rein in your use of the spore drive unless authorised by Starfleet. With respect to the war effort, the fleet will pick up the slack caused by your absence. LORCA: that is a lot of slack. CORNWALL: we will manage. TILLY: Hi, roomie. Oh my God, you look awful. BURNHAM: Thank you, Tilly. TILLY: that is it. we are going to have lunch right now. I mean it. I mean that you are going to tell me what is going on with you. BURNHAM: there is nothing to tell. TILLY: Er, okay. Er, that is okay. I get it. It was bound to happen sometime. There are so many interesting people on this ship, I am sure you have made tons of friends by now. BURNHAM: Tilly, it is not you. it is me. TILLY: Well, since that is very rarely the case in my case, I would love to hear how it is not me. BURNHAM: I am out of sorts, and preoccupied. TILLY: About? BURNHAM: The Tardigrade. Each time we use the spore drive, it gets weaker. TILLY: you are stressed. BURNHAM: I barely have a job here. I have never been less busy. TILLY: But then that gives you the time and space to actually process what you are going through emotionally. BURNHAM: I do not like it. TILLY: Really? I love feeling feelings. (Lorca injects one of his damaged eye. It hurts. Cornwell enters and turns the lights up.) LORCA: Ah! Turn it down. (She does.) CORNWELL: Sorry. I did not know you were still in here. LORCA: Just saddling up for the ride, Admiral. (He injects his other eye.) CORNWELL: Why you did not get your damn eyes fixed? LORCA: Oh you know, Katrina, I do not trust doctors. CORNWELL: Should I take that personally? LORCA: it is punishment for blindsiding me in that pathetic excuse for a strategy session. CORNWELL: Cut the crap, Gabriel. By the way, there is something I did not bring up, lest you think I was piling on. The matter of Michael Burnham. LORCA: No, no, no. Starfleet regulation 139 CORNWELL: Eight two allows you to conscript virtually anyone in time of war. LORCA: And so I have. CORNWELL: This organisation's only convicted mutineer is viewed by many, justifiably or not, as the because of our conflict with the Klingons. To see her avoiding justice does nothing for general morale. LORCA: When I accepted the command, I was given the fullest latitude to fight this war how I saw fit. CORNWELL: But why give everyone another reason to judge you? LORCA: Are you uncomfortable with the power I have been given, Admiral? CORNWELL: I am your friend. LORCA: Mmm hmm. it is my ship, my way. COMPUTER: Warning. Incoming warp signature detected. Klingon class D7 battle cruiser identified. Tractor beam engaged. (Lorca and his pilot grab phaser rifles. The rear hatch opens and the pilot is quickly overpowered, then killed with a bat'leth. KLINGON: Captain Lorca. CORNWELL: The pilot was killed in the subsequent firefight. Capitan Lorca was captured by the Klingons. SARU: Do we know where he was taken, Admiral? CORNWELL: No. By the time we responded to the shuttle's distress beacon, the enemy's warp trail had dissipated. Since you are Acting Captain, I am sending you what little intel we have. This was a targeted abduction. it is possible the Klingons have learned of the existence of Discovery's propulsion system, and taken Lorca to learn more.We need him back, Mister Saru, before they pry those secrets out of him. SARU: We will find him, Admiral. CORNWELL: Good luck. (communication ends) SARU: Lieutenant Detmer, set course for the shuttle's last known coordinates, maximum warp. Lieutenant Owosekun, establish search parameters sector by sector. Calculate potential escape vectors correlating to all known Klingon bases, colonies, and planets, within five lightyears. (His threat ganglia twitch.) SARU: Burnham. What are you doing on the Bridge? BURNHAM: I came to speak to Captain Lorca. SARU: I am afraid that will not be possible. Commander Airiam, alert Lieutenant Stamets that we may be making multiple jumps in rapid succession throughout Klingon space to see if we can track the ship that made the abduction. AIRIAM: Yes, sir. BURNHAM: Multiple jumps? SARU: Do you have an issue with that plan? BURNHAM: I just do not know how feasible it is going to be. BURNHAM: I am concerned that we are negatively impacting the Tardigrade with each jump we make. SARU: I was told it is virtually indestructible. BURNHAM: I disagree with that assessment. SARU: Do you have proof that we are harming it? BURNHAM: Not as of yet. SARU: I am not finding this information to be helpful in any way. We are about to embark on a rescue mission to save the life our Captain. Are you suggesting we forgo that? BURNHAM: No, of course not. I am just worried. I do not know how much more the Tardigrade can sustain. The more you hurt someone, the less helpful they become. SARU: Focus on the task at hand. There will be no more discussion of the Tardigrade until the Captain's back safe. Understood? BURNHAM: Yes, sir. SARU: You may go. (Burnham leaves.) SARU: Computer, list Starfleet's most decorated captains, living and deceased. COMPUTER: Working. (April, Robert. Archer, Jonathan. Decker, Matthew. Georgiou, Philippa. Pike, Christopher.) SARU: Based on their service records, is it possible to identify the qualities most essential to their success? COMPUTER: Characteristics most often cited include bravery, self-sacrifice, intelligence, tactical brilliance, compassion. SARU: Computer, initiate new protocol. Please record all data related to my performance as Acting Captain of Discovery, and cross-reference with success parameters. Note where deviations occur. COMPUTER: State the purpose of the new protocol. SARU: There is an element aboard this ship that causes me to second-guess myself. That cannot continue. I must remain clearheaded in pursuit of today's mission. COMPUTER: Alternative solution. Eliminate destructive element. SARU: Not an option. (Someone is fiddling with Lorca's uniform. He grabs him by the throat.) LORCA: Who are you? MUDD: The name is Mudd. Harcourt Fenton Mudd. Harry for short. I reiterate. Ouch! (Lorca let us him go.) LORCA: Where are we? MUDD: On a resort off Antares Minor. You must try the spa. The hot stone massage is delightful. LORCA: Where are we? MUDD: Typical Starfleet. No fun at all. We are on a Klingon prison vessel. Particularly nasty one. LORCA: what is a civilian like you doing on a Klingon prison vessel? MUDD: The only crime I am guilty of is loving too much. it is true, Captain. I fell for a woman far beyond my reach. Sweet Stella. Her family did not approve of me, so I had no choice except to try and buy her father's respect. Scary, scary man. So I borrowed a large sum from some non-traditional lenders, and gifted her with a moon. It worked like a charm, until I fell behind in my payments. Huh. The creditors came after me, chased me into enemy territory, right into the Klingons' arms, who deposited me here, where I await my fate. (Another man in a Starfleet uniform groans.) MUDD: Oh, I would not bother with him, Captain. I believe the technical term for his condition is out to lunch. Here comes the floor show. KLINGON: Choose your pain. (Mudd points at the groaning man, who gets picked up and thrown around the cell to the cracking of bones and finally gets stomped in the face and dragged out.) MUDD: They may look stupid, our Klingon hosts. they are anything but. They regularly give us the choice to choose our pain. We can accept the beating ourselves, or pass it on to our cellmates. it is our captors' way of keeping us from bonding. LORCA: You seem conspicuously free from bruises. MUDD: I have learned how to choose wisely. do not judge. you are going to want to stick with me. I am a survivor, just like you. CULBER: You should know that Lieutenant Stamets rarely, if ever, listens to me. BURNHAM: I can handle him. CULBER: Please, show me how. BURNHAM: Lieutenant Stamets. Your spore drive is genius. Beyond genius. What you have achieved for the war effort, for the whole of science itself, it is a contribution STAMETS: I know I am brilliant. What are you trying to get out of me? Why are you with her? CULBER: Burnham is worried about the physical effects that Discovery's jumps are having on the Tardigrade. I have done my own evaluations, and I must concur. Scans of its frontal lobe show significant cumulative deterioration every time we go to black alert. BURNHAM: We need to find a work-around. Making Ripper the critical component for the s-drive is unsustainable for the creature and your invention. CULBER: We could lose them both, and with them, any chance of saving Captain Lorca. STAMETS: are not there actual people on this ship who require your attention, Doctor? CULBER: Actually, the CMO does need my help with an Andorian tonsillectomy. (leaves) STAMETS: To be clear, the Tardigrade was your contribution. I never intended to utilise a living creature as a navigation tool. BURNHAM: I did not, either. STAMETS: You say portabella, I say portobello. You are the because of this situation, Burnham. What are you doing with your mouth? BURNHAM: I am swallowing the urge to set the record straight. STAMETS: That will not get us anywhere. Do you want to be right, or do you want to fix this? (Mudd is snoring.) LORCA: I did not realise there were more of us in here. TYLER: I have been pulled out of rotation. Sometimes they let us heal up, so we last longer. Shit, you are a Captain? Here, eat. LORCA: No, you go ahead. TYLER: Sorry sir, I am going to have to insist. We never know when they will feed us. You get keep up your strength. I already lost one Captain, I will not lose another. LORCA: what is your name, soldier? TYLER: Lieutenant Ash Tyler. LORCA: And the captain you lost? TYLER: Steven Maranville, of the USS Yeager. The finest, sir. LORCA: You were at the Battle of the Binaries? TYLER: They gave it a name, huh? that is where I was captured. LORCA: So you have been here seven months. that is funny to you? TYLER: Sorry, sir. it is just, er, if that is true, I am tougher than I thought. LORCA: Or a liar. Nobody survives Klingon torture for seven months. What are you doing here? They got a reason to keep you alive? The Captain of this ship, she is taken a liking to me. LORCA: You must have picked up a few details. what is the crew complement of this vessel? TYLER: can not be certain. Thirty, maybe forty. LORCA: You got a sense of the layout of the decks? TYLER: Uh-huh. (Mudd's snoring stopped a while ago.) LORCA: I got to get my hands on an active comm relay so I can signal my ship for extraction. TYLER: we are deep in enemy territory. there is no way a Federation ship can make it out this far undetected. LORCA: Oh, my ship can. it is like a ghost. (An insect scurries up, grabs Tyler's morsel of food and runs off.) TYLER: Mudd, if I see that pet of yours again Come on, come on, come on. MUDD: Apologises, Lieutenant. Stuart has boundary issues. And besides, we are both a little hungry. LORCA: you would take food out of the mouths of the only two men standing between you and death? MUDD: Damn right I would. Because this is all Starfleet has left me. I used to have a life, Captain. A good one. A respectable business. That all got blown up, because of your goddamn war. LORCA: Starfleet did not start this war. MUDD: Of course you did. The moment you decided to boldly go where no one had gone before. What do you think would happen when you bump into someone who did not want you in their front yard? TYLER: you are siding with the enemy? MUDD: I am not siding with anyone. But I sure as hell understand why the Klingons pushed back. Starfleet arrogance. Have you ever bothered to look out of your spaceships down at the little guys below? If you had, you would realise that there is a lot more of us down there than there are you up here, and we are sick and tired of getting caught in your crossfire. (Klingons come and take Lorca out.) STAMETS: So we need the spore drive to save Captain Lorca, but the spore drive is killing the Tardigrade. All right, let us start with our mushroom, prototaxites stellaviatori, a species made up of exotic material found not only in normal space, but in a discreet subspace domain known as the mycelial network. Its fungal roots, a.k.a. mycelium, spread across the universe, fanning out into infinity to create a matrix that serves as our intergalactic freeway system. BURNHAM: Enter the Tardigrade, whose unique genetic makeup allows it to navigate through the network, because of its symbiotic relationship with the mycelium's spores. Like its microscopic cousins on Earth, the Tardigrade is able to incorporate foreign DNA into its own genome via horizontal gene transfer. When Ripper borrows DNA from the mycelium, he is granted an all-access travel pass. TILLY: Once Lieutenant Stamets conveys the coordinates of a selected destination directly into Ripper he knows exactly where to go. As the Tardigrade's DNA is already sequenced into the computer, can not we build a virtual Ripper? Trick the mycelium into thinking it is communicating with the real thing, and then navigate the ship that way? STAMETS: that is what I am doing with my earlier research. Trying to use software to engage with the network. BURNHAM: And you were only able to achieve small jumps. STAMETS: See now I know why. The spores and the drive were functioning at a fraction of their capacity until we presented the mycelium with an animate copilot. that is the key. The Tardigrade's alive. We just need to integrate the same sequence into a compatible species, one that understands its role in this process and engages willingly. TILLY: You guys, this is so fucking cool. I am so sorry. STAMET: No, Cadet. It is fucking cool. BURNHAM: let us do it. (Lorca is strapped into a metal chair.) L'RELL: Have you ever been tortured, Captain? LORCA: Your English, it is excellent. L'RELL: I am descended from spies. Languages are useful, particularly when it comes to understanding those who seek to destroy the Klingon Empire. LORCA: Little old me? L'RELL: you have been busy these past three weeks, Captain Lorca. It was you who first surprised us in the Corvan system, appearing out of nowhere and then disappearing without a trace. Undetectable. Like a ghost. No other Starfleet vessel can do that. What is your vessel's secret? LORCA: I have no idea what you are talking about. L'RELL: Mmm. You suffer from extreme photosensitivity. LORCA: Well, we all got something, honey. I hear you are seeking solace in the arms of a human male. We do not even have the right number of organs for you. Why so hard-up? (She punches him.) LORCA: Now who is being sensitive? L'RELL: How strange space must look to you now, seen through those damaged eyes. A cosmos full of agonising light. Another creature might have slunk back into the darkness, but not you. You seek glory. (She puts an eyelid speculum onto Lorca.) L'RELL: Perhaps you realise glory must be earned through sacrifice and pain. (Three bright lights are shone into his eyes. Lorca screams.) SARU: Lieutenant Rhys, when will analysis of our long-range sensor data be complete? It is our only hope of closing in on Captain Lorca's location. RHYS: we have narrowed it down to three potential courses, all of which pass near or through the Mempa System. (And past Rura Penthe, fans.) SARU: Very good. Alert Mister Stamets we are ready to proceed with our rescue mission. OWOSEKUN: Lieutenant Stamets has taken the spore drive offline, sir. STAMETS: I do not understand. you would think any number of species would be compatible recipients of the Tardigrade DNA sequence. TILLY: I had the computer run all known life forms in the Federation database. Should I try to access the classified database at the Daystrom Institute? SARU: No, Cadet, you should not. Why did you shut down the spore drive? Up on the Bridge, we are trying to pinpoint coordinates that will lead us to Captain Lorca. STAMETS: we are working on something extremely important. A substitute for the Tardigrade. SARU: Why? STAMETS: Burnham informed me that our jumps are depleting it. SARU: She brought these concerns to me as well, and I told her to stand down until Captain Lorca was safely back on board Discovery. Obviously, this was not the response she wanted. BURNHAM: So far, we found one viable workaround. This hypospray contains Tardigrade DNA and replication catalysts that will initiate rapid horizontal gene transfer in a host. The interface process requires an evolved organism, a species with a highly functioning nervous system. And one that, like the Tardigrade, shares genetic information with mushrooms. The animal kingdom may have diverted from its fungal counterparts 600 million years ago, but Homo Sapiens still share over half of our DNA with them. SARU: You want to use a human? Eugenics experiments are forbidden. BURNHAM: I know. And that is why we need more time. DARU: I gave you an order. Do you understand? BURNHAM: Captain Saru, I understand that you are upset. you are in command. it is a time of crisis. And your culture trains you to be on the heightened lookout for enemies. But I assure you, I am not one of them. SARU: How dare you treat me like one of your xenoanthropology subjects? you are not an enemy, Burnham. You are a proven predator. And I know this not only because my instincts tell me that you are, but because your actions show me that you are. Saving this Tardigrade will neither bring back nor change the fact that this is exactly the kind of behavior that killed Captain Georgiou. RHYS: Bridge to the Captain. We believe we have identified the battle cruiser that is holding Captain Lorca. SARU: Acknowledged. Lieutenant Stamets, bring the drive back online, and prepare the Tardigrade to jump. (to Burnham) Confine yourself to quarters immediately. (Lorca is returned. He goes over to Mudd and pushes him against the wall.) MUDD: Now let us be adults, and use our words, please. (Lorca takes Stuart the bug.) LORCA: Stealing food was just a diversion. he is been transmitting everything we say to the enemy. (He pulls a device off Stuart, drops it and stamps on it.) LORCA: When I first got here, I dropped a little conversational nugget to see if either of you could be trusted, and I just had my words parroted back at me by the Klingon Captain. you have fed intel on every prisoner that passed through here. Ah! (Lorca throws Stuart at the wall.) MUDD: No! Stuart. Stuart. Oh, you almost killed him. TYLER: you are finished. And when it is time to choose our pain, we are choosing you, until there is nothing left. MUDD: Captain, are you really going to let this idealistic young man humiliate himself by siding with you, hmm? Have you no decency, Lorca? Actually, that was a trick question. I know you do not. We both know you lost that with your last command. TYLER: what is he talking about? MUDD: The tragic tale of the USS Buran. It was ambushed about a month into the war. The Klingons boarded it and blasted it into smithereens. Only one crewman managed to escape. Gabriel Lorca. Apparently, the honourable Captain was too good to go down with his ship. LORCA: Mudd's only half right. We were ambushed, and I did escape, but I did not let my crew die. I blew them up. I knew what awaited them on Qo'noS. Degradation. Torture. Slow, public death. it is the Klingon way to spread terror. Not my crew. Not on my watch. MUDD: Well, they say confession is good for the soul. Too bad none of us have one anymore. SARU: Commander Airiam, set displacement parameters to bring us within weapons range of our target Bird-of-Prey. AIRIAM: Aye, sir. SARU: Lieutenant Stamets, are you ready? STAMETS: Yes, Captain. SARU: Black alert. (The Tardigrade is beamed into the cell and the nav computer attaches.) SARU: Go. (Discovery jumps. The nav computer disengages and the Tardigrade collapses. Stamets and Tilly rush into the cell to watch the creature shrivel and shrink, water pouring out of it.) CULBER: The creature has gone into a state of extreme cryptobiosis by reducing the water content levels of its body to less than one percent. Its vital signs have slowed to the point we can barely detect them. SARU: Rehydrate it and bring it back. Mister Rhys, have we been detected? RHYS: Negative. CULBER: Captain Saru, I am not SARU: Location of Klingon prison ship. OWOSEKUN: Point-seven AUs from our position, bearing 13 mark 59. SARU: Match their course and speed, maintain our distance. Cut all systems and run silent. CULBER: Captain, we are not done here. This is not like waking someone from a nap. This is an extreme reaction to adverse conditions. The Tardigrade is in survival mode. SARU: So are we, Doctor. Crack it open if you have to. CULBER: In my opinion, that will kill it. SARU: As it is our only way to get out of Klingon space, it is a risk we must take. CULBER: Captain, neurological tests indicate that this creature may be sentient. SARU: If that ends up being true, I will face the consequences of my actions. I do not enjoy being in this position, but I have 134 souls to protect today. Be ready to force the creature to comply. CULBER: I will not be party to murder. SARU: Doctor, I was not talking to you. Do you understand my orders, and can I count on you to follow them, Lieutenant Stamets? STAMETS: Yes, sir. KLINGON: Choose your pain. TYLER: Choose me, Captain. MUDD: I fully support that idea. TYLER: You do this for me. Choose me. KLINGON: Choose your pain. MUDD: Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. (The Klingon slaps Tyler around and throws him against the wall. Then he turns to Lorca, who attacks the other Klingon while Tyler gets up and has a go at his attacker. They break the Klingons' necks and take their weapons.) MUDD: Where the hell did that come from? TYLER: Getting out of here was always a two-man job. I just waited till I found the right man. MUDD: You played me? Oh, bravura, Mister Tyler. I doff my cap. Now, shall we proceed to our Raider? LORCA: There is no we, Mudd. You sold us out. You stay. MUDD: You can not be serious. LORCA: Oh, but I can. (Lorca hits Mudd with the rifle butt.) MUDD: You can not do this. No, I can not take it in here anymore. Please, I promised Stella that I would come home to her. Please. I promised. No. No. No. (They shut Mudd in the cell.) MUDD: You can not walk away from me, Lorca. I am coming for you. You hear? You have not seen the last of Harcourt Fenton Mudd. (The men vaporise two Klingons with their stolen disrupters, and kill another with its own bat'leth. But a fourth injures Tyler before Lorca can kill it. Lorca carries him a way, then Tyler falls.) LORCA: Get up, soldier. Get up. TYLER: I am slowing you down, sir. Go. LORCA: All right, take cover. I will find a way out and I will come back for you, understand? (Lorca goes round the corner.) L'RELL: Did you really think you could leave me? After all we have been through. (Tyler and L'Rell fight. Tyler gets her on the deck and pummels her face. Lorca returns and vaporises an approaching Klingon. L'Rell pushes Tyler off, and catches the edge of a disrupter ray to the side of her face. She falls, screaming.) LORCA: Tyler, I found the docking bay. Get up. let us go. (L'Rell screams as her face burns up. (Small, near-transparent runabouts with turkey-tails.) LORCA: Redirect all auxiliary power to shields. Blue panel on the right. Five Raiders in pursuit, closing fast. TYLER: Your eyes. That happened when you destroyed the Buran, did not it? LORCA: We choose our own pain. Mine helps me remember. RHYS: Target positions of incoming Raiders and prepare to establish DETMER: Klingon Raiders, sir. Five ships and counting, heading right towards us. SARU: Red alert. OWOSEKUN: We must have been spotted, sir. RHYS: Shall I lock on and prepare to fire? SARU: The leader of the pack seems to have charted an erratic flight pattern. RHYS: We are now within their weapons range. Should I lock phasers, sir? SARU: Predator packs often split into smaller groups while in pursuit. One group initiating the chase, while another travels ahead of the prey's escape path. Hail that Raider. RICHTER: Initiating communication will expose our position. SARU: The lead vessel is being chased. it is our Captain. RICHTER: Federation Starship Discovery to Klingon Raider. RICHTER: Identify yourself. LORCA: Well, what do you know? The cavalry showed up. This is Captain Lorca. LORCA: Two to beam out. Now. SARU: Bridge to transporter room. You have a lock? TRANSPORTER CHIEF Aye, sir. SARU: Lower your shields, Captain Lorca. (Lorca and Tyler are beamed out just before the Raider is destroyed.) (Tyler collapses on the pad.) LORCA: Captain to Bridge. You got us. Jump. Jump now. SARU: Lieutenant Stamets, have you revived the Tardigrade? STAMETS: We are able to jump, Commander. RHYS: The Klingon Raiders detected our transporter signature. - they are locking weapons. SARU: Black alert. Go. LORCA: Easy, soldier. you are home. TYLER: Thank you, Captain. LORCA: For what? Dragging you back into the war on a ship with a target on its back? TYLER: there is no place I would rather be. SARU: Bridge to Stamets. Congratulations, Lieutenant. Excellent work. Lieutenant Stamets, do you copy? OWOSEKUN: Sir, Stamets is in Engineering, but it seems his lifesigns are in distress. COMPUTER: Warning. Failure to initiate spore-drive deactivation sequence. Spore chamber active. Density at 68 percent. Drive system online. SARU: Open this door. COMPUTER: Induction coil saturated. TILLY: Captain, he... he injected himself with the Tardigrade DNA and compound. Is he dead? (Saru checks for a pulse, Stamets gasps.) STAMETS: Did we make it? SARU: Yes. (Stamets laughs hysterically.) (Door bell.) BURNHAM: Come. (Saru enters.) SARU: Captain Lorca has been rescued. On the subject of the Tardigrade, there has been a setback. BURNHAM: Cadet Tilly brought me up to speed. Sir, permission to speak freely. Are you really afraid of me? SARU: I am not. I am angry at you. Angry because of how much you stole from me. I am deeply jealous that I never got the chance you had. BURNHAM: To be Captain Georgiou's First Officer. SARU: You stood by her side and learned everything she had to teach. The anticipated scenario, you would move up and out, Captain your own starship, and I would take your place. I never got that chance. If I had, I would have been more prepared for today. BURNHAM: You did well. Very well. She would have thought so, too. (Burnham gets the case out from under the bed and opens it.) SARU: Her telescope. BURNHAM: She left it to me. it is yours now. You should have the privilege to see the universe the way she did. SARU: Burnham. Captain Lorca has yet to be cleared for command. I have much to attend to, and I could use your help with one thing. BURNHAM: Of course. SARU: Doctor Culber believes the Tardigrade is sentient. It remains in a state of cryptobiosis. We have no claim on its soul. Go save its life, Burnham. that is an order. TILLY: May the sun and moon watch your comings and goings in the endless nights and days that are before you. Are you sure this will work? BURNHAM: No. But if this is its response to an adverse environment, what does it consider to be hospitable? This creature has traveled to the ends of the universe. My hope is that what makes it most happy is to be free. (Burnham pours a small container of spores onto the Tardigrade husk. Tilly activates the platform it is on and it rises up to an airlock, from where it is ejected into space. The creature revives, connects to the mycelium network and jumps away.) COMPUTER: Initiating performance review, Acting Captain Saru. Protocol cancelled. SARU: I know what I did. (Culber is scanning Stamets with a medical tricorder while he brushes his teeth.) STAMETS: Stop. CULBER: Stop what? STAMETS: Stop worrying. Stop doctoring. CULBER: Well, one tends to worry when they are doomed to love a brilliant but reckless maniac who is willing to risk his life for glory. STAMETS: The captain was in danger. CULBER: Captains are in danger every day. STAMETS: You were in danger. I have spent my entire career trying to grasp the essence of mycelium. Now for the first time I do. I saw the network. An entire universe of possibilities I never dreamed existed. it is unspeakably beautiful. I also knew you would leave me if I let anything else endanger that creature. CULBER: Oh, so you do listen to me. STAMETS: Not really. You sold that with a look. CULBER: do not do anything that stupid again. You may not care about you but I do. You sure you feel okay? STAMETS: Yes, dear Doctor. I feel okay. CULBER: Okay. (Stamets turns away from the bathroom mirror, and his reflection watches him leave before turning away itself.)\""

       "\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Enterprise Transcripts - The Aenar\\n\\n\\nThe Aenar\\n Original Airdate: 11 Feb, 2005\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  T'POL:\\r\\nPreviously on Enterprise.\\n\\nARCHER [Ready\\r\\nroom]: From what I've heard about these Romulans, they\\r\\nmean business. We have to find some way to stop them, or next time they\\r\\nmight come back with a thousand of those ships. \\r\\nSHRAN [Conference room]: Unless\\r\\nthis murderer meets me in combat, your precious alliance is finished! \\r\\nSHRAN [Shran's quarters]: The\\r\\nAmbassador's decided to fight in place of his underling? \\r\\nARCHER: Not the Ambassador. \\r\\n(Shots from the fight, and then a shot of the airlock on the Romulan\\r\\nship opening.) \\r\\nARCHER [Bridge]: Trip,\\r\\nMalcolm, we can make one more pass. Get the hell out of there. \\r\\nT'POL: They're clear. \\r\\nNIJIL [Control area]: The\\r\\nDrone has re-entered Romulan space. \\r\\nVALDORE: Disconnect the pilot. \\r\\n(We see the blind, white-skinned Andorian.) \\r\\nGRAL [Conference room]:\\r\\nI believe we have more to discuss than trade disputes. \\r\\nARCHER [OC]: There's no reason our people can't become allies. \\n\\r\\nT'POL [OC]: And now, the conclusion. \\n\\n[Control area]\\n\\nVRAX: This mission was supposed to cause dissension\\r\\nin the region. It's had the opposite effect. \\r\\nVALDORE: Senator, you have a right \\r\\nVRAX: The Andorians and Tellarites have formed an alliance. They're\\r\\nworking together for the first time in history. \\r\\nVALDORE: It won't last. \\r\\nVRAX: The group of senators doesn't share your optimism. They're\\r\\npresenting a motion to cancel this mission. \\r\\nVALDORE: That would be a mistake. \\r\\nVRAX: The mistake was mine when I supported this endeavour. Do you\\r\\nrealise how you've weakened my position? \\r\\nVALDORE: When this is over, you'll be First Consul. \\r\\nVRAX: After a failure of this magnitude, I could be dead. \\r\\nVALDORE: This isn't a failure. It's a setback. We have to deal with the\\r\\nhumans. They are the ones that brought the Andorians and Tellarites\\r\\ntogether. The second Drone ship is armed and ready for battle. With two\\r\\nships, I can deliver a devastating blow. We will hunt down Enterprise\\r\\nand destroy it. \\nCaptain's Starlog, supplemental. A transport ship\\r\\nis returning the Tellarite Ambassador to his homeworld, but Shran has\\r\\noffered to stay and help us track down the marauder. \\n[Conference room]\\n\\nT'POL: The Drone is being operated by telepresence.\\r\\nIt's a process which allows a vessel to be controlled from a remote\\r\\nlocation. \\r\\nSHRAN: We experimented with that years ago. Nothing came of it. \\r\\nT'POL: A pilot can operate the Drone from a great distance, over many\\r\\nlight years. \\r\\nREED: So, there really was no one on that ship. \\r\\nTUCKER: And the people running it are back on their homeworld, safe and\\r\\nsound. \\r\\nT'POL: Essentially. \\r\\nTUCKER: Doesn't seem fair. \\r\\nARCHER: Is there any way to interrupt this telepresence? \\r\\nT'POL: I'm still reviewing the data Commander Tucker brought back, but\\r\\nI believe we can construct our own telepresence unit. \\r\\nTUCKER: And use it to hijack their ship? \\r\\nT'POL: Doubtful. The most we can hope for is to interfere with their\\r\\nnavigation. \\r\\nARCHER: Get started. \\r\\nT'POL: There is one problem. The data from the marauder also contained\\r\\na brain wave pattern. I believe it belongs to the pilot. \\r\\nPHLOX: I've analyzed it. The individual is highly telepathic. \\r\\nT'POL: Apparently, telepathy is necessary to operate the device. \\r\\nARCHER: Vulcans have telepathic powers. \\r\\nPHLOX: Not to this extent. \\r\\nARCHER: Can you identify the species? \\r\\nPHLOX: There's no exact match in my database. However, the nearest\\r\\ngenome is Andorian. \\n[Control area]\\n\\nNIJIL: The humans did considerable damage to the\\r\\nBridge. We'll have to replace the entire receiver array. \\r\\nVALDORE: Assign every spare man to the repair crew. \\r\\nNIJIL: The ship isn't what concerns me. It's the pilot. \\r\\nVALDORE: What about him? \\r\\nNIJIL: Operating the vessel is extremely taxing. \\r\\nVALDORE: He'll have at least three days to rest. \\r\\nNIJIL: That won't be enough. He's suffering from severe mental fatigue.\\r\\nPiloting one ship would be difficult enough, but two \\r\\nVALDORE: Then you'll have to increase the stimulants. \\r\\nNIJIL: The dosage is already at a dangerous level. He could be\\r\\npermanently damaged. He could die. \\r\\nVALDORE: If I didn't know you better, I would say you're more concerned\\r\\nwith this creature's well-being than you are with this mission. \\r\\nNIJIL: Without the pilot, there would be no mission. \\r\\nVALDORE: Just keep him alive long enough to destroy the Earth ship.\\r\\nAfter that, his health is of little consequence. \\n[Ready room]\\n\\nARCHER: Come in. \\r\\nSHRAN: I just received a transmission. Our scientists identified the\\r\\nbrain wave pattern. \\r\\nARCHER: And? \\r\\nSHRAN: It's from my world, but it's not from any Andorian you'd know.\\r\\nIt's Aenar. They're a kind of subspecies. Blind ice-dwellers. For most\\r\\nof our history, they were considered a myth, stories we told our\\r\\nchildren, but fifty years ago, they were discovered living in the\\r\\nNorthern Wastes. They're extremely secretive. I can count on one hand\\r\\nthe number of Andorians who've seen one face-to-face. \\r\\nARCHER: Could they have built a ship like the marauder? \\r\\nSHRAN: I seriously doubt they have the capacity. There are only a few\\r\\nthousand of them left, and even if they could, they're pacifists. They\\r\\ndon't believe in violence. \\r\\nARCHER: One of them does. \\r\\nSHRAN: It seems that way. \\r\\nARCHER: We need to find out who's controlling that ship. \\r\\nSHRAN: Agreed. \\r\\nARCHER: (into comm.) Travis. \\r\\nTRAVIS [OC]: Yes, sir? \\r\\nARCHER: Set a course for Andoria, maximum warp. \\n[Sickbay]\\n\\n(The place is almost filled with strange equipment\\r\\nand thick rubber tubing.) \\r\\nT'POL: You should rest. \\r\\nTUCKER: I just need a second. \\r\\nT'POL: Phlox thinks it's too soon for you to return to duty. \\r\\nTUCKER: Phlox? You were talking to him about me? \\r\\nT'POL: It came up in conversation. \\r\\nTUCKER: Right. Well, I don't have the option of taking a break. The\\r\\nCaptain needs this done fast. \\r\\n(T'Pol is working on modifying a biobed.) \\nT'POL:\\r\\nI can manage. \\r\\nTUCKER: You might be the best there is at crunching numbers, but when\\r\\nit comes to actually sticking things together, you're a little out of\\r\\nyour league. These work better when you strip off the duranite caps.\\r\\nDon't ask me why, they just do. \\r\\nT'POL: I'll make a note of that. \\r\\nTUCKER: You know, when I was on that ship with Malcolm I was convinced\\r\\nI was going to die. You ever been there? \\r\\nT'POL: Since Enterprise was launched, we've all been near death on more\\r\\nthan one occasion. \\r\\nTUCKER: I'm not talking close scrapes. I mean when you're in a bad\\r\\nsituation, and you know this is it, there's no way out, and you have\\r\\ntime to think about it. \\r\\nT'POL: In the Expanse, when we were attempting to destroy Sphere forty\\r\\none, I didn't believe we'd survive. \\r\\nTUCKER: What went through your mind? \\r\\nT'POL: Whether or not to transfer auxiliary power to the deflector\\r\\narray. Why do you ask? \\r\\nTUCKER: Just curious. \\n{Corridor/Transporter alcove]\\n\\n(Enterprise has arrived at a blue planet with a\\r\\nring system and at least two fair-sized moons.) \\r\\nREED: The Aenar compound is surrounded by a dampening field. Once\\r\\nyou're inside, you won't be able to contact the ship. I'd feel much\\r\\nbetter about this if you'd take a couple of MACOs with you. \\r\\nSHRAN: We go in there with a show of force, we won't get a thing out of\\r\\nthem. \\r\\nARCHER: We're going alone. \\r\\nREED: Captain, we don't know anything about these people. \\r\\nARCHER: That's why we're here. Energise. \\n[Andoria]\\n\\n(Which is not the ringed planet, as that is in the\\r\\nsky. Shran and Archer materialise in a place of deep snow which has\\r\\nbeen cut into walls and doorways.) \\r\\nSHRAN: Taste that air. Really gets the blood running. \\r\\n(Archer puts up the hood on his parka then looking at Shran's scanner.)\\r\\n\\nARCHER:\\r\\nTwenty eight below? \\r\\nSHRAN: Lucky for you, it's the middle of summer. \\r\\nARCHER: Yeah. \\r\\nSHRAN: The entrance is twenty metres ahead. The Vulcans say the desert\\r\\nteaches men the meaning of endurance. But it's the ice that forges real\\r\\nstrength. \\r\\nARCHER: It's hard to believe anything can survive here. \\r\\nSHRAN: It isn't easy. Andorian cities are built underground to take\\r\\nadvantage of geothermal energy. I didn't see the sun till I was\\r\\nfifteen. \\r\\n(They wend their way through ice walls, and Shran wobbles then falls to\\r\\nhis knees.) \\r\\nARCHER: Careful, Shran. You don't have your balance back yet. \\r\\nSHRAN: Hands off, pinkskin. These tunnels branch out for thousands of\\r\\nkilometres. Not a good place to get lost. \\n[Control area]\\n\\nNIJIL: We'll be ready to launch in twelve hours. \\r\\nVALDORE: And the pilot? \\r\\nNIJIL: He's resting. \\r\\nVALDORE: Will he be ready? \\r\\nNIJIL: I'll make sure that he is. \\r\\nVALDORE: Spoken like a soldier. \\r\\nNIJIL: I'm a scientist. \\r\\nVALDORE: We're all soldiers, Nijil, from the moment we're born. When we\\r\\nforget that we invite disaster. You know I was once a senator? \\r\\nNIJIL: No. \\r\\nVALDORE: Many years ago. Vrax and I were colleagues. I even considered\\r\\nhim a friend. \\r\\nNIJIL: What happened? \\r\\nVALDORE: I made the mistake of challenging the precept of unlimited\\r\\nexpansion. I asked the question. Is conquest truly the best course for\\r\\nour people? And I was expelled. \\r\\nNIJIL: I'm sorry. \\r\\nVALDORE: I'm not trying to evoke your pity. I want you to learn from my\\r\\nexperience. When I was led away from the Senate chamber, I vowed never\\r\\nto repeat my error and never to forget my purpose. \\r\\nNIJIL: I understand. \\r\\nVALDORE: Continue with your preparations. \\n[Ice tunnels]\\n\\n{Shran spots a lot of bright holes in an arch over\\r\\ntheir path.) \\r\\nSHRAN: Ice-bores. Worms. They live in the ice. Generate heat through a\\r\\nchemical reaction. Big swarm came through here a day or two ago. \\r\\nARCHER: I'm sure Phlox would love to get his hands on one. \\r\\nSHRAN: Best to avoid them. When I was a boy, I stumbled into a large\\r\\nden, wound up with third-degree burns over half my body. \\r\\n(He sways as they stand at the top of a cliff.) \\r\\nARCHER: Shran, listen to me. We should find another way. \\r\\nSHRAN: Afraid of heights, Captain? \\r\\n(He heads down a series of steps cut conveniently in the ice, then\\r\\nsuddenly falls the rest of the way, and lands screaming in pain with a\\r\\nbright blue icicle stuck through his right leg. Archer dashes\\r\\ndown to him.) \\r\\nARCHER:\\xa0Shran! \\r\\nSHRAN: The ice gave out beneath me. \\r\\n(He lifts his own leg off the icicle.) \\r\\nARCHER: You're losing a lot of blood. Hold still. \\r\\n(We see someone is watching as Archer tends Shran's wound.) \\r\\nARCHER: Hold still. Bleeding's stopped, but if you move it could start\\r\\nagain. \\r\\nSHRAN: We can't stay here. We'll freeze to death. \\r\\nARCHER: Archer to Enterprise. Archer to Enterprise. \\r\\nSHRAN: We're well inside the dampening field. \\r\\nARCHER: It doesn't hurt to try. How far are we from the Aenar? (Shran\\r\\nspots the watcher.) \\nSHRAN:\\r\\nI think we just got a lot closer. \\r\\n(Several more of the pale-skinned, pale-dressed people appear.) \\r\\nARCHER: Hello. We need your help. My friend's been hurt. \\r\\nLISSAN: (a woman) We'll assist you. \\n[Sickbay]\\n\\nPHLOX: There's not as much data on the neural\\r\\ninterface as I'd like. \\r\\nT'POL: It's all we have. \\r\\nPHLOX: I can connect someone to the unit, but it'll be dangerous. \\r\\nTUCKER: How dangerous? \\r\\nPHLOX: If the interface malfunctions, there could be severe neurolytic\\r\\nshock, possibly resulting in brain damage. \\r\\nTUCKER: There's got to be some way we can make it safer. \\r\\nPHLOX: Diagnostics will only tell us so much, I'm afraid. \\r\\nT'POL: When can we test it? \\r\\nPHLOX: A day. \\r\\nTUCKER: I want to be the first one to try it out. \\r\\nT'POL: You're not telepathic. It wouldn't be a true measure of the\\r\\nunit's effectiveness. \\r\\nTUCKER: Well, at least we'll find out if it causes brain damage. \\r\\nT'POL: I'll test the unit. \\r\\nTUCKER: You're the ranking officer. Too risky. \\r\\nT'POL: Considering what's at stake, the risk is acceptable. \\r\\nTUCKER: We could at least wait until the Captain gets back. \\r\\nT'POL: Our goal should be to have the unit ready by the time he\\r\\nreturns. That means conducting a full series of tests. The discussion's\\r\\nclosed. We have a lot of work to do. \\n[Aenar city]\\n\\n(Under the ice is a beautiful city of elegant\\r\\ncurved buildings rising up in a massive cavern. In a room with ice\\r\\nfurniture, Shran is being tended on a bed covered with fur when the\\r\\nwoman walks in.) \\r\\nLISSAN: Your wound is healing well. You'll be able to walk on your own\\r\\nin a few hours. \\r\\nSHRAN: My thanks. \\r\\n(The Aenar doctor leaves.) \\r\\nLISSAN: You're Captain Archer. \\r\\nARCHER: You can read minds. \\r\\nLISSAN: We have a strict law here, Captain. No one may enter another's\\r\\nthoughts without permission. I know your name because the Andorian\\r\\nChancellor contacted us. \\r\\nARCHER: I need to speak with someone in authority. \\r\\nLISSAN: We assign our leaders as the need arises. For this occasion, I\\r\\nhave been chosen as Speaker. \\r\\nARCHER: I take it you know why we're here. \\r\\nLISSAN: I know what the Andorians have told us. Someone's been\\r\\nattacking your ships, and you believe we're involved. \\r\\nARCHER: It's a bit more complicated than that. \\r\\nLISSAN: It will save time and foster our trust, if I can have your\\r\\nthoughts. \\r\\n(Shran shakes his head.) \\r\\nARCHER: Go ahead. \\r\\nLISSAN: You have an interesting mind, Captain. Many facets. \\r\\nARCHER: Thank you. \\r\\nLISSAN: Some of those facets are in conflict. \\r\\nSHRAN: That explains a lot. \\r\\nARCHER: Shran. \\r\\nLISSAN: The evidence you've gathered appears irrefutable. It seems\\r\\nthere was an Aenar controlling that ship. \\r\\nARCHER: But you're sceptical. \\r\\nLISSAN: We're a nonviolent people. That a member of our race could\\r\\ncause so much death, it's extremely disturbing. \\r\\nARCHER: Do you have any idea who it could be? \\r\\nLISSAN: There's one possibility. \\r\\nSHRAN: Who? \\r\\nLISSAN: A year ago, one of our citizens disappeared while collecting\\r\\nice-bores. We assumed he'd been killed in an accident, but we never\\r\\nfound his body. \\r\\nSHRAN: Now you know why. \\r\\nLISSAN: Gareb would not be doing this voluntarily. \\r\\nARCHER: You think he was abducted? \\r\\nLISSAN: It's the best explanation. \\r\\nSHRAN: It doesn't matter why he's doing it. He has to be stopped. \\r\\nLISSAN: This device that you're building aboard your ship. \\r\\nARCHER: We're hoping it will disrupt the signal that's controlling the\\r\\nmarauder. \\r\\nLISSAN: You will need one of us to operate it. \\r\\nSHRAN: You owe us that much, at least. \\r\\nLISSAN: I'll consult with the others. \\n[Mess hall]\\n\\nTUCKER: Coffee, strong. \\n[Corridor]\\n\\n(Walking back with his mug.) \\r\\nT'POL: Commander. \\r\\nTUCKER: Hey. \\r\\n(He keeps walking.) \\r\\nT'POL: Trip. I appreciate your concern for my safety. \\r\\nTUCKER: I just don't want Enterprise to lose a good officer. \\r\\nT'POL: I think you're letting your feelings impact your work. \\r\\nTUCKER: My work's as good as it's ever been. As far as my feelings go,\\r\\nthey're purely professional. \\n[Aenar city]\\n\\nSHRAN: I've never been able to sleep with someone\\r\\nstanding at the foot of my bed. \\r\\nJHAMEL: (a younger girl) I didn't mean to disturb you. \\r\\nSHRAN: Actually, I was awake. What is it? \\r\\nJHAMEL: I've never met a blueskin. \\r\\nSHRAN: You're blind. How can you tell my skin is blue? \\r\\nJHAMEL: Don't ask me to explain. I was never very good at science. \\r\\nSHRAN; Neither was I. \\r\\nJHAMEL: Is it true that where you come from, the temperature rises\\r\\nabove freezing for weeks at a time? \\r\\nSHRAN: Every few years, there's a heat wave. I've been on worlds where\\r\\nthe temperature is only slightly below the boiling point of water. \\r\\nJHAMEL: I can't imagine such a place. \\r\\nSHRAN: I'm trying to forget it. I lost ten percent of my body weight in\\r\\ntwo days. \\r\\nJHAMEL: I came here to apologise. \\r\\nSHRAN: For what? \\r\\nJHAMEL: When I saw you for the first time, I sensed some of your\\r\\nthoughts. I didn't intend to. \\r\\nSHRAN: It's never been all that hard to figure out what I'm thinking. \\r\\nJHAMEL: I know what it's like to lose someone. Gareb, the one who's\\r\\nmissing, he's my brother. \\r\\nSHRAN: I'm sorry. \\r\\nJHAMEL: He would never hurt anyone, not intentionally. \\r\\nSHRAN: So we've been told. \\r\\nJHAMEL: Do you think he's in pain? \\r\\nSHRAN: There's no way of knowing. \\r\\nJHAMEL: I have nightmares. Gareb's bound, locked in a strange cage.\\r\\nHe's calling for me. He wants me to rescue him. \\n[Control area]\\n\\n(Gareb is lead back in and put into the pilot's\\r\\nchair.) \\r\\nNIJIL: Forgive me. \\r\\n(Nijil gives Gareb an injection.)\\r\\n\\n[Sickbay]\\n\\n(T'Pol is in Enterprise's equivalent of Gareb's\\r\\nchair, also with a helmet over her head, when Phlox switches it on.) \\r\\nPHLOX: How do you feel? \\r\\nT'POL: I just need a moment. \\r\\nTUCKER: Whenever you're ready. Indicator's moving. Doc? \\r\\nPHLOX: So far, so good. \\r\\nTUCKER: I'll be damned. It's working. \\r\\n(T'Pol tenses and whimpers.) \\r\\nTUCKER: She okay? \\r\\nPHLOX: Her synaptic response is erratic. \\r\\nT'POL: I'll be fine. \\r\\nPHLOX: It's getting worse, Commander. \\r\\nTUCKER: That's enough. Shut it down! \\r\\n(He takes the helmet off her.) \\r\\nPHLOX: You're all right. \\r\\nTUCKER: It worked. \\r\\nT'POL: I'll rest for a few minutes, and then we'll try again. \\n[Aenar city]\\n\\nARCHER: You said Gareb was abducted. If that's\\r\\ntrue, don't you want to help him? \\r\\nLISSAN: Not with violence. \\r\\nARCHER: We're trying to stop violence. \\r\\nLISSAN: I won't deny that your intentions are honourable, but our\\r\\ndecision stands. \\r\\nSHRAN: Forget it, Captain. They've never even helped defend their own\\r\\nworld. We're wasting our time. \\n[Control area]\\n\\nNIJIL: Systems ready. \\r\\nVALDORE: Launch the Drones. \\r\\n(Two ships dash off to warp.)\\r\\n\\n[Andoria, ice tunnels]\\n\\nJHAMEL: You need to rest. \\r\\nSHRAN: I've had enough rest. \\r\\nARCHER: We should clear the dampening field soon.\\r\\nJHAMEL: Wait \\r\\nSHRAN: What is it? \\r\\nJHAMEL: A swarm. \\r\\nSHRAN: I don't see anything. \\r\\n(Then worms drop out of the ceiling in front of them and burrow into\\r\\nthe floor.) \\r\\nJHAMEL: It'll take a few minutes for them to pass. Gareb and I loved\\r\\nchasing ice-bores. Once, we followed a swarm for two hours, caught\\r\\nhundreds of them. We were almost at the surface. My family was very\\r\\nworried. They're going to be worried about me now. \\r\\nSHRAN: Are you sure you want to do this? \\r\\nJHAMEL: I won't abandon my brother. What's it like, your ship? \\r\\nARCHER: Warm. \\n[Sickbay]\\n\\n(Tucker whispers to Phlox, supposedly out of\\r\\nearshot of T'Pol.) \\r\\nTUCKER: She wants to try again. You think it's smart? \\r\\nPHLOX: You know the risks. So does Commander T'Pol. Commander, she's\\r\\ndoing her job. \\r\\nTUCKER: She's going to hurt herself. \\r\\nPHLOX: Take my advice. Don't interfere. \\r\\nTUCKER: I can't believe I'm getting this from you now. Has everyone on\\r\\nthis ship gone crazy? \\r\\nPHLOX: Not everyone. \\r\\nTUCKER: Oh, I'm crazy? \\r\\nPHLOX: It's not your fault. As far as I know, there are no species in\\r\\nthe galaxy that have mastered the art of mixing romance and vocation. \\r\\nTUCKER: You're the last one that should be giving me a lecture. Vulcan\\r\\nneuro-pressure was your idea. \\r\\nPHLOX: You were having trouble sleeping. \\r\\nTUCKER: What the hell am I going to do? \\r\\nPHLOX: This is the one ailment that is universally untreatable. You'll\\r\\nhave to suffer through it. \\n[Andoria, ice tunnels]\\n\\n(There's a familiar lot of holes in the ceiling and\\r\\nfloor.) \\r\\nARCHER: We've been here before. \\r\\nJHAMEL: He's right, we're going in circles. They're trying to stop us. \\r\\nARCHER: How? \\r\\nJHAMEL: They're not letting us see the path to the surface. \\r\\nSHRAN; How could that be possible? \\r\\n(An image of Lissan flickers on the path in front of them.) \\r\\nLISSAN: It's time to come back. \\r\\nJHAMEL: I can't. \\r\\nLISSAN; They're fighting a war. Do you want to be a part of that? \\r\\nJHAMEL: I don't want to fight anyone. I want to help my brother. \\r\\nLISSAN; Help him by standing up for what we believe in. \\r\\nARCHER: She's doing what she thinks is right. \\r\\nLISSAN: She's betraying her people. \\r\\nARCHER: That's not true. Shouldn't she be allowed to follow her own\\r\\nconscience? \\r\\nLISSAN; She's not following her conscience. \\r\\nARCHER: How do you know? Have you read her mind? I thought that was\\r\\nagainst your custom. \\r\\nLISSAN: Jhamel. \\r\\nJHAMEL: Take my thoughts. \\r\\nLISSAN; You're certain this is what you want? \\r\\nJHAMEL: Yes. \\r\\nLISSAN: Very well. \\r\\n(Her image vanishes and they see that they are at the surface, with the\\r\\nringed planet hanging in the sky.)\\r\\n\\nCaptain's Starlog, supplemental. We've returned to\\r\\nEnterprise, where we received word that the cargo ship Ticonderoga is\\r\\nmissing. \\n[Corridor]\\n\\nARCHER: Anything on long range sensors? \\r\\nT'POL: Not yet. \\r\\nARCHER: What's our ETA? \\r\\nT'POL: We'll be at their last known co-ordinates in six hours. \\r\\nARCHER: Tell Malcolm to finish his upgrades to the targeting scanners.\\r\\nIf we run into that marauder again, I want to make sure every shot\\r\\ncounts. \\r\\nT'POL: Understood. \\r\\n(She leaves him and he walks straight into -)\\r\\n\\n[Sickbay]\\n\\nARCHER: Report? \\r\\nTUCKER: She's good to go. \\r\\n(Jhamel is seated on the modified biobed.) \\r\\nARCHER: Whenever you're ready. \\r\\nJHAMEL: I'm ready, Captain. \\r\\n(The helmet is lowered over her head. Tucker reads\\r\\nthe monitor.) \\r\\nTUCKER:\\xa0A lot of movement. Fifty percent spike. \\r\\nARCHER; Are you feeling all right? \\r\\nSHRAN: We can stop anytime you like. \\r\\nJHAMEL: It's strangely enjoyable. \\r\\nTUCKER: She's maxed it out. \\r\\nJHAMEL: Is that good? \\r\\nARCHER: Very good. \\r\\nJHAMEL: Is there another test we can try? \\r\\nTUCKER: We could simulate a course correction. \\r\\n(The biobed sways from side to side, then she gasps.) \\r\\nPHLOX: Synaptic trouble. \\r\\nSHRAN: Shut it down! \\r\\n(They get the helmet off her and Phlox gives her an injection.)\\r\\n\\nCaptain's Starlog, supplemental. We've arrived at\\r\\nthe last known co-ordinates of the Ticonderoga. \\n[Bridge]\\n\\nT'POL: I'm picking up debris. Hull fragments.\\r\\nNacelle casings. Several bodies, human. \\r\\nARCHER: Keep scanning. Try to find the marauder's warp signature. \\r\\nT'POL: Is there any word from Sickbay? \\r\\nARCHER: She's going to be okay, but Phlox says it's too dangerous to\\r\\ntry again. Looks like we went all the way to Andoria for nothing. \\n[Sickbay]\\n\\nJHAMEL: What happened? \\r\\nSHRAN: You had a convulsion. You're all right now. \\r\\nJHAMEL: I was dreaming about Gareb. I failed, didn't I? \\r\\nSHRAN: Ridiculous. That kind of bravery is never a failure. I'm a\\r\\ncommander in the Imperial Guard. I'd be afraid to go anywhere near that\\r\\nthing. \\r\\nJHAMEL: Talas was a fortunate woman. \\r\\nSHRAN: I was the fortunate one. \\r\\nJHAMEL: My brother is going to die, isn't he? \\r\\nSHRAN: I won't hear that from you. \\r\\nJHAMEL: It's hard to be strong. \\r\\nSHRAN: You make it look easy. Keep being strong. For me. \\n[Bridge]\\n\\nT'POL: A ship's dropping out of warp. It appears to\\r\\nbe a Tellarite freighter. \\r\\nARCHER: Tactical Alert. Hail them. Target their engines. \\r\\nT'POL: If it is a freighter. \\r\\nARCHER: Anything? \\r\\n(Hoshi shakes her head.) \\r\\nTRAVIS: One hundred kilometres. \\r\\nARCHER: Fire. \\r\\n(The freighter loses its holographic skin and reverts to its proper\\r\\nappearance - a Drone, which attacks.) \\r\\nARCHER; Aim for their weapons. \\r\\nREED; They're too damned fast. I can't get a target lock. \\n[Sickbay]\\n\\nJHAMEL: What's happening? \\r\\nSHRAN: We're under attack. I'm going to the Bridge. \\r\\nJHAMEL: Wait. I can feel him. \\r\\n(She gets up.) \\r\\nPHLOX; Where do you think you're going? \\r\\nJHAMEL: Connect me to the device, I need to try again. \\r\\nPHLOX; I can't allow it. You barely survived the last attempt. \\r\\nJHAMEL: I can reach him. I can make him stop. \\r\\nSHRAN: Let her try. \\n[Control area]\\n\\nNIJIL: Enterprise is taking heavy damage. \\r\\nVALDORE: Target with the second Drone. Attack vector one seven seven. \\r\\nNIJIL: It may not be necessary. \\r\\nVALDORE: Follow my orders. \\r\\nNIJIL: Yes, Admiral. \\n[Bridge]\\n\\nREED: Another ship's approaching, bearing oh one\\r\\nsix mark twelve. An Andorian battle cruiser. \\r\\nARCHER: T'Pol? \\r\\nT'POL: It's power signature is not Andorian. \\r\\nARCHER: Target them! \\r\\nT'POL: Captain, I'm picking up an energy reading from Sickbay. It's the\\r\\ntelepresence unit. \\r\\nARCHER: Archer to Sickbay. What's going on? \\n[Sickbay]\\n\\nPHLOX; Jhamel's going to make another attempt. \\n[Bridge]\\n\\nARCHER: Is she up to it? \\n[Sickbay]\\n\\nPHLOX: She's quite insistent. \\r\\n(The second Drone reveals its true appearance.) \\r\\nPHLOX: Cortical fluctuation. It could trigger a seizure. \\r\\nSHRAN: Jhamel. \\r\\nJHAMEL: I can do it. \\r\\nPHLOX: Disconnect her. Now! \\r\\nJHAMEL: No! \\r\\nSHRAN: She can do this. \\n[Control area]\\n\\nNIJIL: They've lost warp power. \\r\\nVALDORE: Continue targeting their engines. \\r\\nNIJIL: Someone's tapping into the telemetric array. \\n[Telepathic conversation]\\n\\nGAREB: Jhamel? \\r\\nJHAMEL: It's me. \\r\\nGAREB: It's not possible. How? \\r\\nJHAMEL: You have to stop what you're doing. \\r\\nGAREB: Where are you? \\r\\nJHAMEL: I'm on the ship you're attacking. \\n[Control area]\\n\\nVALDORE: Both Drones are coming to a stop. We're\\r\\ndefenceless. \\n[Bridge]\\n\\nREED: They've stopped firing. \\n[Telepathic conversation]\\n\\nGAREB: I thought you were dead. They said I was the\\r\\nlast surviving Aenar. \\r\\nJHAMEL: They lied to you. \\r\\nGAREB: I've killed so many people. \\r\\nJHAMEL: It wasn't you. It was them, they forced you. You can stop it.\\r\\nYou know what you have to do. \\n[Control area]\\n\\nNIJIL: The first Drone is targeting the second. \\r\\nVALDORE: Take all weapons offline. \\r\\nNIJIL: I've lost access. \\n[Bridge]\\n\\nREED: They're attacking each other. \\r\\nARCHER: Let's give them a hand. Photonic torpedoes, full spread. \\r\\nREED: Aye, sir. \\n[Control area]\\n\\nVALDORE: (grabbing Gareb) Stop this! Now. \\r\\nNIJIL: No! \\r\\nVALDORE: Resume your attack on the Earth ship. \\n[Telepathic conversation]\\n\\nGAREB: Remember me, Jhamel. \\r\\nJHAMEL: Gareb! \\r\\n(As one Drone blows the other to pieces, Valdore kills Gareb. Shran and\\r\\nPhlox get Jhamel out of the telepresence device and Reed blows up the\\r\\nother Drone. Shran comforts Jhamel.) \\n Captain's Starlog, supplemental. There's been no\\nsign of any other marauder ships. We're returning Shran and Jhamel to\\nAndoria. \\n [Transporter alcove] \\nARCHER: I want to thank you again. \\r\\nJHAMEL: I owe you a thanks. If I hadn't come with you, my brother would\\r\\nhave died alone. Goodbye, Captain. \\r\\nARCHER: Goodbye. \\r\\nSHRAN: I regret much of what happened between us recently. \\r\\nARCHER: Same here. \\r\\nSHRAN: When you lose your ship, you aren't usually rewarded with\\r\\nanother one. I may not see you for a while. \\r\\nT'POL: If there's anything we can do or say on your behalf. \\r\\nSHRAN: I appreciate the offer. Let's just see what the future brings.\\r\\nTry to stay out of trouble, pinkskin. \\n[Deleted Scene - Control area]\\n\\n Valdore is sitting in the Drone helm seat\\r\\nwhen Vrax and two Reman enter.) \\r\\nVALDORE: Senator, I assume I'm under arrest. \\r\\nVRAX: We're both under arrest. \\r\\nVALDORE: So it seems I'll be serving with you again. Nijil, goodbye. \\r\\nNIJIL: The failure is mine, not yours. \\r\\nVALDORE: Spoken like a soldier. \\r\\n(Vrax and Valdore are taken away.)  \\n[Ready room]\\n\\nARCHER: Come in. \\r\\n(Tucker enters.) \\r\\nARCHER: I've been looking over your report. I think you're being a\\r\\nlittle hard on yourself. \\r\\nTUCKER: There's no getting around it. I missed a ten degree variance in\\r\\nthe telepresence emitter. \\r\\nARCHER: I spoke with Phlox. He doesn't think it had anything to do with\\r\\nJhamel's seizure. \\r\\nTUCKER: But he can't be sure. Either way, I should have caught it. \\r\\nARCHER: We were all under a lot of pressure. \\r\\nTUCKER: My mind wasn't on the job. \\r\\nARCHER: If that were true, we probably wouldn't be standing here now. \\r\\nTUCKER: Captain, I want a transfer. \\r\\nARCHER: Where? \\r\\nTUCKER: Columbia. They need experienced people. \\r\\nARCHER: You turned them down twice before. Why now? \\r\\nTUCKER: I think I can do some good over there. \\r\\nARCHER: I need you here, Trip. \\r\\nTUCKER: They need me more. \\r\\nARCHER: What's this really about? \\r\\nTUCKER: I told you. \\r\\nARCHER: I haven't heard one thing that explains this. \\r\\nTUCKER: I've said everything I want to. \\r\\nARCHER: That's it? I'm supposed to accept that? And if I refuse your\\r\\ntransfer? \\r\\nTUCKER: Captain, as a friend, I'm asking you let me do this. \\r\\nARCHER: It's your career, Trip. But as a friend, I'm asking you to\\r\\nstay. \\r\\nTUCKER: I can't. \\r\\nARCHER: All right. \\r\\nTUCKER: Thank you. \\r\\nARCHER: Dismissed.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<Back\\r\\nto the episode listing\\nStar\\r\\nTrek ® is copyright of CBS\\r\\nStudios Inc.

       "\"The Enterprise Transcripts - The Aenar The Aenar Original Airdate: 11 Feb, 2005 T'POL: Previously on Enterprise. ARCHER: From what I've heard about these Romulans, they mean business. We have to find some way to stop them, or next time they might come back with a thousand of those ships. SHRAN: Unless this murderer meets me in combat, your precious alliance is finished! SHRAN: The Ambassador's decided to fight in place of his underling? ARCHER: Not the Ambassador. (Shots from the fight, and then a shot of the airlock on the Romulan ship opening.) ARCHER: Trip, Malcolm, we can make one more pass. Get the hell out of there. T'POL: They're clear. NIJIL: The Drone has re-entered Romulan space. VALDORE: Disconnect the pilot. (We see the blind, white-skinned Andorian.) GRAL: I believe we have more to discuss than trade disputes. ARCHER: There's no reason our people can't become allies. T'POL: And now, the conclusion.  VRAX: This mission was supposed to cause dissension in the region. It's had the opposite effect. VALDORE: Senator, you have a right VRAX: The Andorians and Tellarites have formed an alliance. They're working together for the first time in history. VALDORE: It won't last. VRAX: The group of senators doesn't share your optimism. They're presenting a motion to cancel this mission. VALDORE: That would be a mistake. VRAX: The mistake was mine when I supported this endeavour. Do you realise how you've weakened my position? VALDORE: When this is over, you'll be First Consul. VRAX: After a failure of this magnitude, I could be dead. VALDORE: This isn't a failure. It's a setback. We have to deal with the humans. They are the ones that brought the Andorians and Tellarites together. The second Drone ship is armed and ready for battle. With two ships, I can deliver a devastating blow. We will hunt down Enterprise and destroy it. Captain's Starlog, supplemental. A transport ship is returning the Tellarite Ambassador to his homeworld, but Shran has offered to stay and help us track down the marauder.  T'POL: The Drone is being operated by telepresence. It's a process which allows a vessel to be controlled from a remote location. SHRAN: We experimented with that years ago. Nothing came of it. T'POL: A pilot can operate the Drone from a great distance, over many light years. REED: So, there really was no one on that ship. TUCKER: And the people running it are back on their homeworld, safe and sound. T'POL: Essentially. TUCKER: Doesn't seem fair. ARCHER: Is there any way to interrupt this telepresence? T'POL: I'm still reviewing the data Commander Tucker brought back, but I believe we can construct our own telepresence unit. TUCKER: And use it to hijack their ship? T'POL: Doubtful. The most we can hope for is to interfere with their navigation. ARCHER: Get started. T'POL: There is one problem. The data from the marauder also contained a brain wave pattern. I believe it belongs to the pilot. PHLOX: I've analyzed it. The individual is highly telepathic. T'POL: Apparently, telepathy is necessary to operate the device. ARCHER: Vulcans have telepathic powers. PHLOX: Not to this extent. ARCHER: Can you identify the species? PHLOX: There's no exact match in my database. However, the nearest genome is Andorian.  NIJIL: The humans did considerable damage to the Bridge. We'll have to replace the entire receiver array. VALDORE: Assign every spare man to the repair crew. NIJIL: The ship isn't what concerns me. It's the pilot. VALDORE: What about him? NIJIL: Operating the vessel is extremely taxing. VALDORE: He'll have at least three days to rest. NIJIL: That won't be enough. He's suffering from severe mental fatigue. Piloting one ship would be difficult enough, but two VALDORE: Then you'll have to increase the stimulants. NIJIL: The dosage is already at a dangerous level. He could be permanently damaged. He could die. VALDORE: If I didn't know you better, I would say you're more concerned with this creature's well-being than you are with this mission. NIJIL: Without the pilot, there would be no mission. VALDORE: Just keep him alive long enough to destroy the Earth ship. After that, his health is of little consequence.  ARCHER: Come in. SHRAN: I just received a transmission. Our scientists identified the brain wave pattern. ARCHER: And? SHRAN: It's from my world, but it's not from any Andorian you'd know. It's Aenar. They're a kind of subspecies. Blind ice-dwellers. For most of our history, they were considered a myth, stories we told our children, but fifty years ago, they were discovered living in the Northern Wastes. They're extremely secretive. I can count on one hand the number of Andorians who've seen one face-to-face. ARCHER: Could they have built a ship like the marauder? SHRAN: I seriously doubt they have the capacity. There are only a few thousand of them left, and even if they could, they're pacifists. They don't believe in violence. ARCHER: One of them does. SHRAN: It seems that way. ARCHER: We need to find out who's controlling that ship. SHRAN: Agreed. ARCHER: (into comm.) Travis. TRAVIS: Yes, sir? ARCHER: Set a course for Andoria, maximum warp.  (The place is almost filled with strange equipment and thick rubber tubing.) T'POL: You should rest. TUCKER: I just need a second. T'POL: Phlox thinks it's too soon for you to return to duty. TUCKER: Phlox? You were talking to him about me? T'POL: It came up in conversation. TUCKER: Right. Well, I don't have the option of taking a break. The Captain needs this done fast. (T'Pol is working on modifying a biobed.) T'POL: I can manage. TUCKER: You might be the best there is at crunching numbers, but when it comes to actually sticking things together, you're a little out of your league. These work better when you strip off the duranite caps. Don't ask me why, they just do. T'POL: I'll make a note of that. TUCKER: You know, when I was on that ship with Malcolm I was convinced I was going to die. You ever been there? T'POL: Since Enterprise was launched, we've all been near death on more than one occasion. TUCKER: I'm not talking close scrapes. I mean when you're in a bad situation, and you know this is it, there's no way out, and you have time to think about it. T'POL: In the Expanse, when we were attempting to destroy Sphere forty one, I didn't believe we'd survive. TUCKER: What went through your mind? T'POL: Whether or not to transfer auxiliary power to the deflector array. Why do you ask? TUCKER: Just curious. {Corridor/Transporter alcove] (Enterprise has arrived at a blue planet with a ring system and at least two fair-sized moons.) REED: The Aenar compound is surrounded by a dampening field. Once you're inside, you won't be able to contact the ship. I'd feel much better about this if you'd take a couple of MACOs with you. SHRAN: We go in there with a show of force, we won't get a thing out of them. ARCHER: We're going alone. REED: Captain, we don't know anything about these people. ARCHER: That's why we're here. Energise.  (Which is not the ringed planet, as that is in the sky. Shran and Archer materialise in a place of deep snow which has been cut into walls and doorways.) SHRAN: Taste that air. Really gets the blood running. (Archer puts up the hood on his parka then looking at Shran's scanner.) ARCHER: Twenty eight below? SHRAN: Lucky for you, it's the middle of summer. ARCHER: Yeah. SHRAN: The entrance is twenty metres ahead. The Vulcans say the desert teaches men the meaning of endurance. But it's the ice that forges real strength. ARCHER: It's hard to believe anything can survive here. SHRAN: It isn't easy. Andorian cities are built underground to take advantage of geothermal energy. I didn't see the sun till I was fifteen. (They wend their way through ice walls, and Shran wobbles then falls to his knees.) ARCHER: Careful, Shran. You don't have your balance back yet. SHRAN: Hands off, pinkskin. These tunnels branch out for thousands of kilometres. Not a good place to get lost.  NIJIL: We'll be ready to launch in twelve hours. VALDORE: And the pilot? NIJIL: He's resting. VALDORE: Will he be ready? NIJIL: I'll make sure that he is. VALDORE: Spoken like a soldier. NIJIL: I'm a scientist. VALDORE: We're all soldiers, Nijil, from the moment we're born. When we forget that we invite disaster. You know I was once a senator? NIJIL: No. VALDORE: Many years ago. Vrax and I were colleagues. I even considered him a friend. NIJIL: What happened? VALDORE: I made the mistake of challenging the precept of unlimited expansion. I asked the question. Is conquest truly the best course for our people? And I was expelled. NIJIL: I'm sorry. VALDORE: I'm not trying to evoke your pity. I want you to learn from my experience. When I was led away from the Senate chamber, I vowed never to repeat my error and never to forget my purpose. NIJIL: I understand. VALDORE: Continue with your preparations.  {Shran spots a lot of bright holes in an arch over their path.) SHRAN: Ice-bores. Worms. They live in the ice. Generate heat through a chemical reaction. Big swarm came through here a day or two ago. ARCHER: I'm sure Phlox would love to get his hands on one. SHRAN: Best to avoid them. When I was a boy, I stumbled into a large den, wound up with third-degree burns over half my body. (He sways as they stand at the top of a cliff.) ARCHER: Shran, listen to me. We should find another way. SHRAN: Afraid of heights, Captain? (He heads down a series of steps cut conveniently in the ice, then suddenly falls the rest of the way, and lands screaming in pain with a bright blue icicle stuck through his right leg. Archer dashes down to him.) ARCHER: Shran! SHRAN: The ice gave out beneath me. (He lifts his own leg off the icicle.) ARCHER: You're losing a lot of blood. Hold still. (We see someone is watching as Archer tends Shran's wound.) ARCHER: Hold still. Bleeding's stopped, but if you move it could start again. SHRAN: We can't stay here. We'll freeze to death. ARCHER: Archer to Enterprise. Archer to Enterprise. SHRAN: We're well inside the dampening field. ARCHER: It doesn't hurt to try. How far are we from the Aenar? (Shran spots the watcher.) SHRAN: I think we just got a lot closer. (Several more of the pale-skinned, pale-dressed people appear.) ARCHER: Hello. We need your help. My friend's been hurt. LISSAN: (a woman) We'll assist you.  PHLOX: There's not as much data on the neural interface as I'd like. T'POL: It's all we have. PHLOX: I can connect someone to the unit, but it'll be dangerous. TUCKER: How dangerous? PHLOX: If the interface malfunctions, there could be severe neurolytic shock, possibly resulting in brain damage. TUCKER: There's got to be some way we can make it safer. PHLOX: Diagnostics will only tell us so much, I'm afraid. T'POL: When can we test it? PHLOX: A day. TUCKER: I want to be the first one to try it out. T'POL: You're not telepathic. It wouldn't be a true measure of the unit's effectiveness. TUCKER: Well, at least we'll find out if it causes brain damage. T'POL: I'll test the unit. TUCKER: You're the ranking officer. Too risky. T'POL: Considering what's at stake, the risk is acceptable. TUCKER: We could at least wait until the Captain gets back. T'POL: Our goal should be to have the unit ready by the time he returns. That means conducting a full series of tests. The discussion's closed. We have a lot of work to do.  (Under the ice is a beautiful city of elegant curved buildings rising up in a massive cavern. In a room with ice furniture, Shran is being tended on a bed covered with fur when the woman walks in.) LISSAN: Your wound is healing well. You'll be able to walk on your own in a few hours. SHRAN: My thanks. (The Aenar doctor leaves.) LISSAN: You're Captain Archer. ARCHER: You can read minds. LISSAN: We have a strict law here, Captain. No one may enter another's thoughts without permission. I know your name because the Andorian Chancellor contacted us. ARCHER: I need to speak with someone in authority. LISSAN: We assign our leaders as the need arises. For this occasion, I have been chosen as Speaker. ARCHER: I take it you know why we're here. LISSAN: I know what the Andorians have told us. Someone's been attacking your ships, and you believe we're involved. ARCHER: It's a bit more complicated than that. LISSAN: It will save time and foster our trust, if I can have your thoughts. (Shran shakes his head.) ARCHER: Go ahead. LISSAN: You have an interesting mind, Captain. Many facets. ARCHER: Thank you. LISSAN: Some of those facets are in conflict. SHRAN: That explains a lot. ARCHER: Shran. LISSAN: The evidence you've gathered appears irrefutable. It seems there was an Aenar controlling that ship. ARCHER: But you're sceptical. LISSAN: We're a nonviolent people. That a member of our race could cause so much death, it's extremely disturbing. ARCHER: Do you have any idea who it could be? LISSAN: There's one possibility. SHRAN: Who? LISSAN: A year ago, one of our citizens disappeared while collecting ice-bores. We assumed he'd been killed in an accident, but we never found his body. SHRAN: Now you know why. LISSAN: Gareb would not be doing this voluntarily. ARCHER: You think he was abducted? LISSAN: It's the best explanation. SHRAN: It doesn't matter why he's doing it. He has to be stopped. LISSAN: This device that you're building aboard your ship. ARCHER: We're hoping it will disrupt the signal that's controlling the marauder. LISSAN: You will need one of us to operate it. SHRAN: You owe us that much, at least. LISSAN: I'll consult with the others.  TUCKER: Coffee, strong.  (Walking back with his mug.) T'POL: Commander. TUCKER: Hey. (He keeps walking.) T'POL: Trip. I appreciate your concern for my safety. TUCKER: I just don't want Enterprise to lose a good officer. T'POL: I think you're letting your feelings impact your work. TUCKER: My work's as good as it's ever been. As far as my feelings go, they're purely professional.  SHRAN: I've never been able to sleep with someone standing at the foot of my bed. JHAMEL: (a younger girl) I didn't mean to disturb you. SHRAN: Actually, I was awake. What is it? JHAMEL: I've never met a blueskin. SHRAN: You're blind. How can you tell my skin is blue? JHAMEL: Don't ask me to explain. I was never very good at science. SHRAN; Neither was I. JHAMEL: Is it true that where you come from, the temperature rises above freezing for weeks at a time? SHRAN: Every few years, there's a heat wave. I've been on worlds where the temperature is only slightly below the boiling point of water. JHAMEL: I can't imagine such a place. SHRAN: I'm trying to forget it. I lost ten percent of my body weight in two days. JHAMEL: I came here to apologise. SHRAN: For what? JHAMEL: When I saw you for the first time, I sensed some of your thoughts. I didn't intend to. SHRAN: It's never been all that hard to figure out what I'm thinking. JHAMEL: I know what it's like to lose someone. Gareb, the one who's missing, he's my brother. SHRAN: I'm sorry. JHAMEL: He would never hurt anyone, not intentionally. SHRAN: So we've been told. JHAMEL: Do you think he's in pain? SHRAN: There's no way of knowing. JHAMEL: I have nightmares. Gareb's bound, locked in a strange cage. He's calling for me. He wants me to rescue him.  (Gareb is lead back in and put into the pilot's chair.) NIJIL: Forgive me. (Nijil gives Gareb an injection.)  (T'Pol is in Enterprise's equivalent of Gareb's chair, also with a helmet over her head, when Phlox switches it on.) PHLOX: How do you feel? T'POL: I just need a moment. TUCKER: Whenever you're ready. Indicator's moving. Doc? PHLOX: So far, so good. TUCKER: I'll be damned. It's working. (T'Pol tenses and whimpers.) TUCKER: She okay? PHLOX: Her synaptic response is erratic. T'POL: I'll be fine. PHLOX: It's getting worse, Commander. TUCKER: That's enough. Shut it down! (He takes the helmet off her.) PHLOX: You're all right. TUCKER: It worked. T'POL: I'll rest for a few minutes, and then we'll try again.  ARCHER: You said Gareb was abducted. If that's true, don't you want to help him? LISSAN: Not with violence. ARCHER: We're trying to stop violence. LISSAN: I won't deny that your intentions are honourable, but our decision stands. SHRAN: Forget it, Captain. They've never even helped defend their own world. We're wasting our time.  NIJIL: Systems ready. VALDORE: Launch the Drones. (Two ships dash off to warp.)  JHAMEL: You need to rest. SHRAN: I've had enough rest. ARCHER: We should clear the dampening field soon. JHAMEL: Wait SHRAN: What is it? JHAMEL: A swarm. SHRAN: I don't see anything. (Then worms drop out of the ceiling in front of them and burrow into the floor.) JHAMEL: It'll take a few minutes for them to pass. Gareb and I loved chasing ice-bores. Once, we followed a swarm for two hours, caught hundreds of them. We were almost at the surface. My family was very worried. They're going to be worried about me now. SHRAN: Are you sure you want to do this? JHAMEL: I won't abandon my brother. What's it like, your ship? ARCHER: Warm.  (Tucker whispers to Phlox, supposedly out of earshot of T'Pol.) TUCKER: She wants to try again. You think it's smart? PHLOX: You know the risks. So does Commander T'Pol. Commander, she's doing her job. TUCKER: She's going to hurt herself. PHLOX: Take my advice. Don't interfere. TUCKER: I can't believe I'm getting this from you now. Has everyone on this ship gone crazy? PHLOX: Not everyone. TUCKER: Oh, I'm crazy? PHLOX: It's not your fault. As far as I know, there are no species in the galaxy that have mastered the art of mixing romance and vocation. TUCKER: You're the last one that should be giving me a lecture. Vulcan neuro-pressure was your idea. PHLOX: You were having trouble sleeping. TUCKER: What the hell am I going to do? PHLOX: This is the one ailment that is universally untreatable. You'll have to suffer through it.  (There's a familiar lot of holes in the ceiling and floor.) ARCHER: We've been here before. JHAMEL: He's right, we're going in circles. They're trying to stop us. ARCHER: How? JHAMEL: They're not letting us see the path to the surface. SHRAN; How could that be possible? (An image of Lissan flickers on the path in front of them.) LISSAN: It's time to come back. JHAMEL: I can't. LISSAN; They're fighting a war. Do you want to be a part of that? JHAMEL: I don't want to fight anyone. I want to help my brother. LISSAN; Help him by standing up for what we believe in. ARCHER: She's doing what she thinks is right. LISSAN: She's betraying her people. ARCHER: That's not true. Shouldn't she be allowed to follow her own conscience? LISSAN; She's not following her conscience. ARCHER: How do you know? Have you read her mind? I thought that was against your custom. LISSAN: Jhamel. JHAMEL: Take my thoughts. LISSAN; You're certain this is what you want? JHAMEL: Yes. LISSAN: Very well. (Her image vanishes and they see that they are at the surface, with the ringed planet hanging in the sky.) Captain's Starlog, supplemental. We've returned to Enterprise, where we received word that the cargo ship Ticonderoga is missing.  ARCHER: Anything on long range sensors? T'POL: Not yet. ARCHER: What's our ETA? T'POL: We'll be at their last known co-ordinates in six hours. ARCHER: Tell Malcolm to finish his upgrades to the targeting scanners. If we run into that marauder again, I want to make sure every shot counts. T'POL: Understood. (She leaves him and he walks straight into -)  ARCHER: Report? TUCKER: She's good to go. (Jhamel is seated on the modified biobed.) ARCHER: Whenever you're ready. JHAMEL: I'm ready, Captain. (The helmet is lowered over her head. Tucker reads the monitor.) TUCKER: A lot of movement. Fifty percent spike. ARCHER; Are you feeling all right? SHRAN: We can stop anytime you like. JHAMEL: It's strangely enjoyable. TUCKER: She's maxed it out. JHAMEL: Is that good? ARCHER: Very good. JHAMEL: Is there another test we can try? TUCKER: We could simulate a course correction. (The biobed sways from side to side, then she gasps.) PHLOX: Synaptic trouble. SHRAN: Shut it down! (They get the helmet off her and Phlox gives her an injection.) Captain's Starlog, supplemental. We've arrived at the last known co-ordinates of the Ticonderoga.  T'POL: I'm picking up debris. Hull fragments. Nacelle casings. Several bodies, human. ARCHER: Keep scanning. Try to find the marauder's warp signature. T'POL: Is there any word from Sickbay? ARCHER: She's going to be okay, but Phlox says it's too dangerous to try again. Looks like we went all the way to Andoria for nothing.  JHAMEL: What happened? SHRAN: You had a convulsion. You're all right now. JHAMEL: I was dreaming about Gareb. I failed, didn't I? SHRAN: Ridiculous. That kind of bravery is never a failure. I'm a commander in the Imperial Guard. I'd be afraid to go anywhere near that thing. JHAMEL: Talas was a fortunate woman. SHRAN: I was the fortunate one. JHAMEL: My brother is going to die, isn't he? SHRAN: I won't hear that from you. JHAMEL: It's hard to be strong. SHRAN: You make it look easy. Keep being strong. For me.  T'POL: A ship's dropping out of warp. It appears to be a Tellarite freighter. ARCHER: Tactical Alert. Hail them. Target their engines. T'POL: If it is a freighter. ARCHER: Anything? (Hoshi shakes her head.) TRAVIS: One hundred kilometres. ARCHER: Fire. (The freighter loses its holographic skin and reverts to its proper appearance - a Drone, which attacks.) ARCHER; Aim for their weapons. REED; They're too damned fast. I can't get a target lock.  JHAMEL: What's happening? SHRAN: We're under attack. I'm going to the Bridge. JHAMEL: Wait. I can feel him. (She gets up.) PHLOX; Where do you think you're going? JHAMEL: Connect me to the device, I need to try again. PHLOX; I can't allow it. You barely survived the last attempt. JHAMEL: I can reach him. I can make him stop. SHRAN: Let her try.  NIJIL: Enterprise is taking heavy damage. VALDORE: Target with the second Drone. Attack vector one seven seven. NIJIL: It may not be necessary. VALDORE: Follow my orders. NIJIL: Yes, Admiral.  REED: Another ship's approaching, bearing oh one six mark twelve. An Andorian battle cruiser. ARCHER: T'Pol? T'POL: It's power signature is not Andorian. ARCHER: Target them! T'POL: Captain, I'm picking up an energy reading from Sickbay. It's the telepresence unit. ARCHER: Archer to Sickbay. What's going on?  PHLOX; Jhamel's going to make another attempt.  ARCHER: Is she up to it?  PHLOX: She's quite insistent. (The second Drone reveals its true appearance.) PHLOX: Cortical fluctuation. It could trigger a seizure. SHRAN: Jhamel. JHAMEL: I can do it. PHLOX: Disconnect her. Now! JHAMEL: No! SHRAN: She can do this.  NIJIL: They've lost warp power. VALDORE: Continue targeting their engines. NIJIL: Someone's tapping into the telemetric array.  GAREB: Jhamel? JHAMEL: It's me. GAREB: It's not possible. How? JHAMEL: You have to stop what you're doing. GAREB: Where are you? JHAMEL: I'm on the ship you're attacking.  VALDORE: Both Drones are coming to a stop. We're defenceless.  REED: They've stopped firing.  GAREB: I thought you were dead. They said I was the last surviving Aenar. JHAMEL: They lied to you. GAREB: I've killed so many people. JHAMEL: It wasn't you. It was them, they forced you. You can stop it. You know what you have to do.  NIJIL: The first Drone is targeting the second. VALDORE: Take all weapons offline. NIJIL: I've lost access.  REED: They're attacking each other. ARCHER: Let's give them a hand. Photonic torpedoes, full spread. REED: Aye, sir.  VALDORE: (grabbing Gareb) Stop this! Now. NIJIL: No! VALDORE: Resume your attack on the Earth ship.  GAREB: Remember me, Jhamel. JHAMEL: Gareb! (As one Drone blows the other to pieces, Valdore kills Gareb. Shran and Phlox get Jhamel out of the telepresence device and Reed blows up the other Drone. Shran comforts Jhamel.) Captain's Starlog, supplemental. There's been no sign of any other marauder ships. We're returning Shran and Jhamel to Andoria.  ARCHER: I want to thank you again. JHAMEL: I owe you a thanks. If I hadn't come with you, my brother would have died alone. Goodbye, Captain. ARCHER: Goodbye. SHRAN: I regret much of what happened between us recently. ARCHER: Same here. SHRAN: When you lose your ship, you aren't usually rewarded with another one. I may not see you for a while. T'POL: If there's anything we can do or say on your behalf. SHRAN: I appreciate the offer. Let's just see what the future brings. Try to stay out of trouble, pinkskin.  Valdore is sitting in the Drone helm seat when Vrax and two Reman enter.) VALDORE: Senator, I assume I'm under arrest. VRAX: We're both under arrest. VALDORE: So it seems I'll be serving with you again. Nijil, goodbye. NIJIL: The failure is mine, not yours. VALDORE: Spoken like a soldier. (Vrax and Valdore are taken away.)  ARCHER: Come in. (Tucker enters.) ARCHER: I've been looking over your report. I think you're being a little hard on yourself. TUCKER: There's no getting around it. I missed a ten degree variance in the telepresence emitter. ARCHER: I spoke with Phlox. He doesn't think it had anything to do with Jhamel's seizure. TUCKER: But he can't be sure. Either way, I should have caught it. ARCHER: We were all under a lot of pressure. TUCKER: My mind wasn't on the job. ARCHER: If that were true, we probably wouldn't be standing here now. TUCKER: Captain, I want a transfer. ARCHER: Where? TUCKER: Columbia. They need experienced people. ARCHER: You turned them down twice before. Why now? TUCKER: I think I can do some good over there. ARCHER: I need you here, Trip. TUCKER: They need me more. ARCHER: What's this really about? TUCKER: I told you. ARCHER: I haven't heard one thing that explains this. TUCKER: I've said everything I want to. ARCHER: That's it? I'm supposed to accept that? And if I refuse your transfer? TUCKER: Captain, as a friend, I'm asking you let me do this. ARCHER: It's your career, Trip. But as a friend, I'm asking you to stay. TUCKER: I can't. ARCHER: All right. TUCKER: Thank you. ARCHER: Dismissed. <Back to the episode listing Star Trek is copyright of CBS Studios Inc. Copyright 1966, Present.

For most of our history, they were considered a myth, stories we told our children, but fifty years ago, they were discovered living in the Northern Wastes. They're extremely secretive.

       "\"The Enterprise Transcripts - The Aenar The Aenar Original Airdate: 11 Feb, 2005 T'POL: Previously on Enterprise. ARCHER: From what I've heard about these Romulans, they mean business. We have to find some way to stop them, or next time they might come back with a thousand of those ships. SHRAN: Unless this murderer meets me in combat, your precious alliance is finished! SHRAN: The Ambassador's decided to fight in place of his underling? ARCHER: Not the Ambassador. (Shots from the fight, and then a shot of the airlock on the Romulan ship opening.) ARCHER: Trip, Malcolm, we can make one more pass. Get the hell out of there. T'POL: They're clear. NIJIL: The Drone has re-entered Romulan space. VALDORE: Disconnect the pilot. (We see the blind, white-skinned Andorian.) GRAL: I believe we have more to discuss than trade disputes. ARCHER: There's no reason our people can't become allies. T'POL: And now, the conclusion.  VRAX: This mission was supposed to cause dissension in the region. It's had the opposite effect. VALDORE: Senator, you have a right VRAX: The Andorians and Tellarites have formed an alliance. They're working together for the first time in history. VALDORE: It won't last. VRAX: The group of senators doesn't share your optimism. They're presenting a motion to cancel this mission. VALDORE: That would be a mistake. VRAX: The mistake was mine when I supported this endeavour. Do you realise how you've weakened my position? VALDORE: When this is over, you'll be First Consul. VRAX: After a failure of this magnitude, I could be dead. VALDORE: This isn't a failure. It's a setback. We have to deal with the humans. They are the ones that brought the Andorians and Tellarites together. The second Drone ship is armed and ready for battle. With two ships, I can deliver a devastating blow. We will hunt down Enterprise and destroy it. Captain's Starlog, supplemental. A transport ship is returning the Tellarite Ambassador to his homeworld, but Shran has offered to stay and help us track down the marauder.  T'POL: The Drone is being operated by telepresence. It's a process which allows a vessel to be controlled from a remote location. SHRAN: We experimented with that years ago. Nothing came of it. T'POL: A pilot can operate the Drone from a great distance, over many light years. REED: So, there really was no one on that ship. TUCKER: And the people running it are back on their homeworld, safe and sound. T'POL: Essentially. TUCKER: Doesn't seem fair. ARCHER: Is there any way to interrupt this telepresence? T'POL: I'm still reviewing the data Commander Tucker brought back, but I believe we can construct our own telepresence unit. TUCKER: And use it to hijack their ship? T'POL: Doubtful. The most we can hope for is to interfere with their navigation. ARCHER: Get started. T'POL: There is one problem. The data from the marauder also contained a brain wave pattern. I believe it belongs to the pilot. PHLOX: I've analyzed it. The individual is highly telepathic. T'POL: Apparently, telepathy is necessary to operate the device. ARCHER: Vulcans have telepathic powers. PHLOX: Not to this extent. ARCHER: Can you identify the species? PHLOX: There's no exact match in my database. However, the nearest genome is Andorian.  NIJIL: The humans did considerable damage to the Bridge. We'll have to replace the entire receiver array. VALDORE: Assign every spare man to the repair crew. NIJIL: The ship isn't what concerns me. It's the pilot. VALDORE: What about him? NIJIL: Operating the vessel is extremely taxing. VALDORE: He'll have at least three days to rest. NIJIL: That won't be enough. He's suffering from severe mental fatigue. Piloting one ship would be difficult enough, but two VALDORE: Then you'll have to increase the stimulants. NIJIL: The dosage is already at a dangerous level. He could be permanently damaged. He could die. VALDORE: If I didn't know you better, I would say you're more concerned with this creature's well-being than you are with this mission. NIJIL: Without the pilot, there would be no mission. VALDORE: Just keep him alive long enough to destroy the Earth ship. After that, his health is of little consequence.  ARCHER: Come in. SHRAN: I just received a transmission. Our scientists identified the brain wave pattern. ARCHER: And? SHRAN: It's from my world, but it's not from any Andorian you'd know. It's Aenar. They're a kind of subspecies. Blind ice-dwellers. For most of our history, they were considered a myth, stories we told our children, but fifty years ago, they were discovered living in the Northern Wastes. They're extremely secretive. I can count on one hand the number of Andorians who've seen one face-to-face. ARCHER: Could they have built a ship like the marauder? SHRAN: I seriously doubt they have the capacity. There are only a few thousand of them left, and even if they could, they're pacifists. They don't believe in violence. ARCHER: One of them does. SHRAN: It seems that way. ARCHER: We need to find out who's controlling that ship. SHRAN: Agreed. ARCHER: (into comm.) Travis. TRAVIS: Yes, sir? ARCHER: Set a course for Andoria, maximum warp.  (The place is almost filled with strange equipment and thick rubber tubing.) T'POL: You should rest. TUCKER: I just need a second. T'POL: Phlox thinks it's too soon for you to return to duty. TUCKER: Phlox? You were talking to him about me? T'POL: It came up in conversation. TUCKER: Right. Well, I don't have the option of taking a break. The Captain needs this done fast. (T'Pol is working on modifying a biobed.) T'POL: I can manage. TUCKER: You might be the best there is at crunching numbers, but when it comes to actually sticking things together, you're a little out of your league. These work better when you strip off the duranite caps. Don't ask me why, they just do. T'POL: I'll make a note of that. TUCKER: You know, when I was on that ship with Malcolm I was convinced I was going to die. You ever been there? T'POL: Since Enterprise was launched, we've all been near death on more than one occasion. TUCKER: I'm not talking close scrapes. I mean when you're in a bad situation, and you know this is it, there's no way out, and you have time to think about it. T'POL: In the Expanse, when we were attempting to destroy Sphere forty one, I didn't believe we'd survive. TUCKER: What went through your mind? T'POL: Whether or not to transfer auxiliary power to the deflector array. Why do you ask? TUCKER: Just curious. {Corridor/Transporter alcove] (Enterprise has arrived at a blue planet with a ring system and at least two fair-sized moons.) REED: The Aenar compound is surrounded by a dampening field. Once you're inside, you won't be able to contact the ship. I'd feel much better about this if you'd take a couple of MACOs with you. SHRAN: We go in there with a show of force, we won't get a thing out of them. ARCHER: We're going alone. REED: Captain, we don't know anything about these people. ARCHER: That's why we're here. Energise.  (Which is not the ringed planet, as that is in the sky. Shran and Archer materialise in a place of deep snow which has been cut into walls and doorways.) SHRAN: Taste that air. Really gets the blood running. (Archer puts up the hood on his parka then looking at Shran's scanner.) ARCHER: Twenty eight below? SHRAN: Lucky for you, it's the middle of summer. ARCHER: Yeah. SHRAN: The entrance is twenty metres ahead. The Vulcans say the desert teaches men the meaning of endurance. But it's the ice that forges real strength. ARCHER: It's hard to believe anything can survive here. SHRAN: It isn't easy. Andorian cities are built underground to take advantage of geothermal energy. I didn't see the sun till I was fifteen. (They wend their way through ice walls, and Shran wobbles then falls to his knees.) ARCHER: Careful, Shran. You don't have your balance back yet. SHRAN: Hands off, pinkskin. These tunnels branch out for thousands of kilometres. Not a good place to get lost.  NIJIL: We'll be ready to launch in twelve hours. VALDORE: And the pilot? NIJIL: He's resting. VALDORE: Will he be ready? NIJIL: I'll make sure that he is. VALDORE: Spoken like a soldier. NIJIL: I'm a scientist. VALDORE: We're all soldiers, Nijil, from the moment we're born. When we forget that we invite disaster. You know I was once a senator? NIJIL: No. VALDORE: Many years ago. Vrax and I were colleagues. I even considered him a friend. NIJIL: What happened? VALDORE: I made the mistake of challenging the precept of unlimited expansion. I asked the question. Is conquest truly the best course for our people? And I was expelled. NIJIL: I'm sorry. VALDORE: I'm not trying to evoke your pity. I want you to learn from my experience. When I was led away from the Senate chamber, I vowed never to repeat my error and never to forget my purpose. NIJIL: I understand. VALDORE: Continue with your preparations.  {Shran spots a lot of bright holes in an arch over their path.) SHRAN: Ice-bores. Worms. They live in the ice. Generate heat through a chemical reaction. Big swarm came through here a day or two ago. ARCHER: I'm sure Phlox would love to get his hands on one. SHRAN: Best to avoid them. When I was a boy, I stumbled into a large den, wound up with third-degree burns over half my body. (He sways as they stand at the top of a cliff.) ARCHER: Shran, listen to me. We should find another way. SHRAN: Afraid of heights, Captain? (He heads down a series of steps cut conveniently in the ice, then suddenly falls the rest of the way, and lands screaming in pain with a bright blue icicle stuck through his right leg. Archer dashes down to him.) ARCHER: Shran! SHRAN: The ice gave out beneath me. (He lifts his own leg off the icicle.) ARCHER: You're losing a lot of blood. Hold still. (We see someone is watching as Archer tends Shran's wound.) ARCHER: Hold still. Bleeding's stopped, but if you move it could start again. SHRAN: We can't stay here. We'll freeze to death. ARCHER: Archer to Enterprise. Archer to Enterprise. SHRAN: We're well inside the dampening field. ARCHER: It doesn't hurt to try. How far are we from the Aenar? (Shran spots the watcher.) SHRAN: I think we just got a lot closer. (Several more of the pale-skinned, pale-dressed people appear.) ARCHER: Hello. We need your help. My friend's been hurt. LISSAN: (a woman) We'll assist you.  PHLOX: There's not as much data on the neural interface as I'd like. T'POL: It's all we have. PHLOX: I can connect someone to the unit, but it'll be dangerous. TUCKER: How dangerous? PHLOX: If the interface malfunctions, there could be severe neurolytic shock, possibly resulting in brain damage. TUCKER: There's got to be some way we can make it safer. PHLOX: Diagnostics will only tell us so much, I'm afraid. T'POL: When can we test it? PHLOX: A day. TUCKER: I want to be the first one to try it out. T'POL: You're not telepathic. It wouldn't be a true measure of the unit's effectiveness. TUCKER: Well, at least we'll find out if it causes brain damage. T'POL: I'll test the unit. TUCKER: You're the ranking officer. Too risky. T'POL: Considering what's at stake, the risk is acceptable. TUCKER: We could at least wait until the Captain gets back. T'POL: Our goal should be to have the unit ready by the time he returns. That means conducting a full series of tests. The discussion's closed. We have a lot of work to do.  (Under the ice is a beautiful city of elegant curved buildings rising up in a massive cavern. In a room with ice furniture, Shran is being tended on a bed covered with fur when the woman walks in.) LISSAN: Your wound is healing well. You'll be able to walk on your own in a few hours. SHRAN: My thanks. (The Aenar doctor leaves.) LISSAN: You're Captain Archer. ARCHER: You can read minds. LISSAN: We have a strict law here, Captain. No one may enter another's thoughts without permission. I know your name because the Andorian Chancellor contacted us. ARCHER: I need to speak with someone in authority. LISSAN: We assign our leaders as the need arises. For this occasion, I have been chosen as Speaker. ARCHER: I take it you know why we're here. LISSAN: I know what the Andorians have told us. Someone's been attacking your ships, and you believe we're involved. ARCHER: It's a bit more complicated than that. LISSAN: It will save time and foster our trust, if I can have your thoughts. (Shran shakes his head.) ARCHER: Go ahead. LISSAN: You have an interesting mind, Captain. Many facets. ARCHER: Thank you. LISSAN: Some of those facets are in conflict. SHRAN: That explains a lot. ARCHER: Shran. LISSAN: The evidence you've gathered appears irrefutable. It seems there was an Aenar controlling that ship. ARCHER: But you're sceptical. LISSAN: We're a nonviolent people. That a member of our race could cause so much death, it's extremely disturbing. ARCHER: Do you have any idea who it could be? LISSAN: There's one possibility. SHRAN: Who? LISSAN: A year ago, one of our citizens disappeared while collecting ice-bores. We assumed he'd been killed in an accident, but we never found his body. SHRAN: Now you know why. LISSAN: Gareb would not be doing this voluntarily. ARCHER: You think he was abducted? LISSAN: It's the best explanation. SHRAN: It doesn't matter why he's doing it. He has to be stopped. LISSAN: This device that you're building aboard your ship. ARCHER: We're hoping it will disrupt the signal that's controlling the marauder. LISSAN: You will need one of us to operate it. SHRAN: You owe us that much, at least. LISSAN: I'll consult with the others.  TUCKER: Coffee, strong.  (Walking back with his mug.) T'POL: Commander. TUCKER: Hey. (He keeps walking.) T'POL: Trip. I appreciate your concern for my safety. TUCKER: I just don't want Enterprise to lose a good officer. T'POL: I think you're letting your feelings impact your work. TUCKER: My work's as good as it's ever been. As far as my feelings go, they're purely professional.  SHRAN: I've never been able to sleep with someone standing at the foot of my bed. JHAMEL: (a younger girl) I didn't mean to disturb you. SHRAN: Actually, I was awake. What is it? JHAMEL: I've never met a blueskin. SHRAN: You're blind. How can you tell my skin is blue? JHAMEL: Don't ask me to explain. I was never very good at science. SHRAN; Neither was I. JHAMEL: Is it true that where you come from, the temperature rises above freezing for weeks at a time? SHRAN: Every few years, there's a heat wave. I've been on worlds where the temperature is only slightly below the boiling point of water. JHAMEL: I can't imagine such a place. SHRAN: I'm trying to forget it. I lost ten percent of my body weight in two days. JHAMEL: I came here to apologise. SHRAN: For what? JHAMEL: When I saw you for the first time, I sensed some of your thoughts. I didn't intend to. SHRAN: It's never been all that hard to figure out what I'm thinking. JHAMEL: I know what it's like to lose someone. Gareb, the one who's missing, he's my brother. SHRAN: I'm sorry. JHAMEL: He would never hurt anyone, not intentionally. SHRAN: So we've been told. JHAMEL: Do you think he's in pain? SHRAN: There's no way of knowing. JHAMEL: I have nightmares. Gareb's bound, locked in a strange cage. He's calling for me. He wants me to rescue him.  (Gareb is lead back in and put into the pilot's chair.) NIJIL: Forgive me. (Nijil gives Gareb an injection.)  (T'Pol is in Enterprise's equivalent of Gareb's chair, also with a helmet over her head, when Phlox switches it on.) PHLOX: How do you feel? T'POL: I just need a moment. TUCKER: Whenever you're ready. Indicator's moving. Doc? PHLOX: So far, so good. TUCKER: I'll be damned. It's working. (T'Pol tenses and whimpers.) TUCKER: She okay? PHLOX: Her synaptic response is erratic. T'POL: I'll be fine. PHLOX: It's getting worse, Commander. TUCKER: That's enough. Shut it down! (He takes the helmet off her.) PHLOX: You're all right. TUCKER: It worked. T'POL: I'll rest for a few minutes, and then we'll try again.  ARCHER: You said Gareb was abducted. If that's true, don't you want to help him? LISSAN: Not with violence. ARCHER: We're trying to stop violence. LISSAN: I won't deny that your intentions are honourable, but our decision stands. SHRAN: Forget it, Captain. They've never even helped defend their own world. We're wasting our time.  NIJIL: Systems ready. VALDORE: Launch the Drones. (Two ships dash off to warp.)  JHAMEL: You need to rest. SHRAN: I've had enough rest. ARCHER: We should clear the dampening field soon. JHAMEL: Wait SHRAN: What is it? JHAMEL: A swarm. SHRAN: I don't see anything. (Then worms drop out of the ceiling in front of them and burrow into the floor.) JHAMEL: It'll take a few minutes for them to pass. Gareb and I loved chasing ice-bores. Once, we followed a swarm for two hours, caught hundreds of them. We were almost at the surface. My family was very worried. They're going to be worried about me now. SHRAN: Are you sure you want to do this? JHAMEL: I won't abandon my brother. What's it like, your ship? ARCHER: Warm.  (Tucker whispers to Phlox, supposedly out of earshot of T'Pol.) TUCKER: She wants to try again. You think it's smart? PHLOX: You know the risks. So does Commander T'Pol. Commander, she's doing her job. TUCKER: She's going to hurt herself. PHLOX: Take my advice. Don't interfere. TUCKER: I can't believe I'm getting this from you now. Has everyone on this ship gone crazy? PHLOX: Not everyone. TUCKER: Oh, I'm crazy? PHLOX: It's not your fault. As far as I know, there are no species in the galaxy that have mastered the art of mixing romance and vocation. TUCKER: You're the last one that should be giving me a lecture. Vulcan neuro-pressure was your idea. PHLOX: You were having trouble sleeping. TUCKER: What the hell am I going to do? PHLOX: This is the one ailment that is universally untreatable. You'll have to suffer through it.  (There's a familiar lot of holes in the ceiling and floor.) ARCHER: We've been here before. JHAMEL: He's right, we're going in circles. They're trying to stop us. ARCHER: How? JHAMEL: They're not letting us see the path to the surface. SHRAN; How could that be possible? (An image of Lissan flickers on the path in front of them.) LISSAN: It's time to come back. JHAMEL: I can't. LISSAN; They're fighting a war. Do you want to be a part of that? JHAMEL: I don't want to fight anyone. I want to help my brother. LISSAN; Help him by standing up for what we believe in. ARCHER: She's doing what she thinks is right. LISSAN: She's betraying her people. ARCHER: That's not true. Shouldn't she be allowed to follow her own conscience? LISSAN; She's not following her conscience. ARCHER: How do you know? Have you read her mind? I thought that was against your custom. LISSAN: Jhamel. JHAMEL: Take my thoughts. LISSAN; You're certain this is what you want? JHAMEL: Yes. LISSAN: Very well. (Her image vanishes and they see that they are at the surface, with the ringed planet hanging in the sky.) Captain's Starlog, supplemental. We've returned to Enterprise, where we received word that the cargo ship Ticonderoga is missing.  ARCHER: Anything on long range sensors? T'POL: Not yet. ARCHER: What's our ETA? T'POL: We'll be at their last known co-ordinates in six hours. ARCHER: Tell Malcolm to finish his upgrades to the targeting scanners. If we run into that marauder again, I want to make sure every shot counts. T'POL: Understood. (She leaves him and he walks straight into -)  ARCHER: Report? TUCKER: She's good to go. (Jhamel is seated on the modified biobed.) ARCHER: Whenever you're ready. JHAMEL: I'm ready, Captain. (The helmet is lowered over her head. Tucker reads the monitor.) TUCKER: A lot of movement. Fifty percent spike. ARCHER; Are you feeling all right? SHRAN: We can stop anytime you like. JHAMEL: It's strangely enjoyable. TUCKER: She's maxed it out. JHAMEL: Is that good? ARCHER: Very good. JHAMEL: Is there another test we can try? TUCKER: We could simulate a course correction. (The biobed sways from side to side, then she gasps.) PHLOX: Synaptic trouble. SHRAN: Shut it down! (They get the helmet off her and Phlox gives her an injection.) Captain's Starlog, supplemental. We've arrived at the last known co-ordinates of the Ticonderoga.  T'POL: I'm picking up debris. Hull fragments. Nacelle casings. Several bodies, human. ARCHER: Keep scanning. Try to find the marauder's warp signature. T'POL: Is there any word from Sickbay? ARCHER: She's going to be okay, but Phlox says it's too dangerous to try again. Looks like we went all the way to Andoria for nothing.  JHAMEL: What happened? SHRAN: You had a convulsion. You're all right now. JHAMEL: I was dreaming about Gareb. I failed, didn't I? SHRAN: Ridiculous. That kind of bravery is never a failure. I'm a commander in the Imperial Guard. I'd be afraid to go anywhere near that thing. JHAMEL: Talas was a fortunate woman. SHRAN: I was the fortunate one. JHAMEL: My brother is going to die, isn't he? SHRAN: I won't hear that from you. JHAMEL: It's hard to be strong. SHRAN: You make it look easy. Keep being strong. For me.  T'POL: A ship's dropping out of warp. It appears to be a Tellarite freighter. ARCHER: Tactical Alert. Hail them. Target their engines. T'POL: If it is a freighter. ARCHER: Anything? (Hoshi shakes her head.) TRAVIS: One hundred kilometres. ARCHER: Fire. (The freighter loses its holographic skin and reverts to its proper appearance - a Drone, which attacks.) ARCHER; Aim for their weapons. REED; They're too damned fast. I can't get a target lock.  JHAMEL: What's happening? SHRAN: We're under attack. I'm going to the Bridge. JHAMEL: Wait. I can feel him. (She gets up.) PHLOX; Where do you think you're going? JHAMEL: Connect me to the device, I need to try again. PHLOX; I can't allow it. You barely survived the last attempt. JHAMEL: I can reach him. I can make him stop. SHRAN: Let her try.  NIJIL: Enterprise is taking heavy damage. VALDORE: Target with the second Drone. Attack vector one seven seven. NIJIL: It may not be necessary. VALDORE: Follow my orders. NIJIL: Yes, Admiral.  REED: Another ship's approaching, bearing oh one six mark twelve. An Andorian battle cruiser. ARCHER: T'Pol? T'POL: It's power signature is not Andorian. ARCHER: Target them! T'POL: Captain, I'm picking up an energy reading from Sickbay. It's the telepresence unit. ARCHER: Archer to Sickbay. What's going on?  PHLOX; Jhamel's going to make another attempt.  ARCHER: Is she up to it?  PHLOX: She's quite insistent. (The second Drone reveals its true appearance.) PHLOX: Cortical fluctuation. It could trigger a seizure. SHRAN: Jhamel. JHAMEL: I can do it. PHLOX: Disconnect her. Now! JHAMEL: No! SHRAN: She can do this.  NIJIL: They've lost warp power. VALDORE: Continue targeting their engines. NIJIL: Someone's tapping into the telemetric array.  GAREB: Jhamel? JHAMEL: It's me. GAREB: It's not possible. How? JHAMEL: You have to stop what you're doing. GAREB: Where are you? JHAMEL: I'm on the ship you're attacking.  VALDORE: Both Drones are coming to a stop. We're defenceless.  REED: They've stopped firing.  GAREB: I thought you were dead. They said I was the last surviving Aenar. JHAMEL: They lied to you. GAREB: I've killed so many people. JHAMEL: It wasn't you. It was them, they forced you. You can stop it. You know what you have to do.  NIJIL: The first Drone is targeting the second. VALDORE: Take all weapons offline. NIJIL: I've lost access.  REED: They're attacking each other. ARCHER: Let's give them a hand. Photonic torpedoes, full spread. REED: Aye, sir.  VALDORE: (grabbing Gareb) Stop this! Now. NIJIL: No! VALDORE: Resume your attack on the Earth ship.  GAREB: Remember me, Jhamel. JHAMEL: Gareb! (As one Drone blows the other to pieces, Valdore kills Gareb. Shran and Phlox get Jhamel out of the telepresence device and Reed blows up the other Drone. Shran comforts Jhamel.) Captain's Starlog, supplemental. There's been no sign of any other marauder ships. We're returning Shran and Jhamel to Andoria.  ARCHER: I want to thank you again. JHAMEL: I owe you a thanks. If I hadn't come with you, my brother would have died alone. Goodbye, Captain. ARCHER: Goodbye. SHRAN: I regret much of what happened between us recently. ARCHER: Same here. SHRAN: When you lose your ship, you aren't usually rewarded with another one. I may not see you for a while. T'POL: If there's anything we can do or say on your behalf. SHRAN: I appreciate the offer. Let's just see what the future brings. Try to stay out of trouble, pinkskin.  Valdore is sitting in the Drone helm seat when Vrax and two Reman enter.) VALDORE: Senator, I assume I'm under arrest. VRAX: We're both under arrest. VALDORE: So it seems I'll be serving with you again. Nijil, goodbye. NIJIL: The failure is mine, not yours. VALDORE: Spoken like a soldier. (Vrax and Valdore are taken away.)  ARCHER: Come in. (Tucker enters.) ARCHER: I've been looking over your report. I think you're being a little hard on yourself. TUCKER: There's no getting around it. I missed a ten degree variance in the telepresence emitter. ARCHER: I spoke with Phlox. He doesn't think it had anything to do with Jhamel's seizure. TUCKER: But he can't be sure. Either way, I should have caught it. ARCHER: We were all under a lot of pressure. TUCKER: My mind wasn't on the job. ARCHER: If that were true, we probably wouldn't be standing here now. TUCKER: Captain, I want a transfer. ARCHER: Where? TUCKER: Columbia. They need experienced people. ARCHER: You turned them down twice before. Why now? TUCKER: I think I can do some good over there. ARCHER: I need you here, Trip. TUCKER: They need me more. ARCHER: What's this really about? TUCKER: I told you. ARCHER: I haven't heard one thing that explains this. TUCKER: I've said everything I want to. ARCHER: That's it? I'm supposed to accept that? And if I refuse your transfer? TUCKER: Captain, as a friend, I'm asking you let me do this. ARCHER: It's your career, Trip. But as a friend, I'm asking you to stay. TUCKER: I can't. ARCHER: All right. TUCKER: Thank you.

or next time they might come back with a thousand of those ships shran conference room unless this murderer meets me in combat your precious alliance is finished shran shrans quarters the ambassadors decided to fight in place of his underling archer not the ambassador shots from the fight and then a shot of the airlock on the romulan ship opening archer bridge trip malcolm we can make one more pass get the hell out of there tpol they are clear nijil control area the drone has reentered romulan space valdore disconnect the pilot we see the blind whiteskinned andorian gral conference room i believe we have more to discuss than trade disputes archer oc there is no reason our people can not become allies tpol oc and now the conclusion control area vrax this mission was supposed to because dissension in the region it is had the opposite effect valdore senator you have a right vrax the andorians and tellarites have formed an alliance they are working together for the first time in history valdore it will not last vrax the group of senators does not share your optimism they are presenting a motion to cancel this mission valdore that would be a mistake vrax the mistake was mine when i supported this endeavour do you realise how you have weakened my position valdore when this is over you will be first consul vrax after a failure of this magnitude i could be dead valdore this is not a failure it is a setback we have to deal with the humans they are the ones that brought the andorians and tellarites together the second drone ship is armed and ready for battle with two ships i can deliver a devastating blow we will hunt down enterprise and destroy it captains starlog supplemental a transport ship is returning the tellarite ambassador to his homeworld but shran has offered to stay and help us track down the marauder conference room tpol the drone is being operated by telepresence it is a process which allows a vessel to be controlled from a remote location shran we experimented with that years ago nothing came of it tpol a pilot can operate the drone from a great distance over many light years reed so there really was no one on that ship tucker and the people running it are back on their homeworld safe and sound tpol essentially tucker does not seem fair archer is there any way to interrupt this telepresence tpol i am still reviewing the data commander tucker brought back but i believe we can construct our own telepresence unit tucker and use it to hijack their ship tpol doubtful the most we can hope for is to interfere with their navigation archer get started tpol there is one problem the data from the marauder also contained a brain wave pattern i believe it belongs to the pilot phlox i have analyzed it the individual is highly telepathic tpol apparently telepathy is necessary to operate the device archer vulcans have telepathic powers phlox not to this extent archer can you identify the species phlox there is no exact match in my database however the nearest genome is andorian control area nijil the humans did considerable damage to the bridge we will have to replace the entire receiver array valdore assign every spare man to the repair crew nijil the ship is not what concerns me it is the pilot valdore what about him nijil operating the vessel is extremely taxing valdore he will have at least three days to rest nijil that will not be enough he is suffering from severe mental fatigue piloting one ship would be difficult enough but two valdore then you will have to increase the stimulants nijil the dosage is already at a dangerous level he could be permanently damaged he could die valdore if i did not know you better i would say you are more concerned with this creatures wellbeing than you are with this mission nijil without the pilot there would be no mission valdore just keep him alive long enough to destroy the earth ship after that his health is of little consequence ready room archer come in shran i just received a transmission our scientists identified the brain wave pattern archer and shran it is from my world but it is not from any andorian you would know it is aenar they are a kind of subspecies blind icedwellers for most of our history they were considered a myth stories we told our children but fifty years ago they were discovered living in the northern wastes they are extremely secretive i can count on one hand the number of andorians who have seen one facetoface archer could they have built a ship like the marauder shran i seriously doubt they have the capacity there are only a few thousand of them left and even if they could they are pacifists they do not believe in violence archer one of them does shran it seems that way archer we need to find out who is controlling that ship shran agreed archer into comm travis travis oc yes sir archer set a course for andoria maximum warp sickbay the place is almost filled with strange equipment and thick rubber tubing tpol you should rest tucker i just need a second tpol phlox thinks it is too soon for you to return to duty tucker phlox you were talking to him about me tpol it came up in conversation tucker right well i do not have the option of taking a break the captain needs this done fast tpol is working on modifying a biobed tpol i can manage tucker you might be the best there is at crunching numbers but when it comes to actually sticking things together you are a little out of your league these work better when you strip off the duranite caps do not ask me why they just do tpol i will make a note of that tucker you know when i was on that ship with malcolm i was convinced i was going to die you ever been there tpol since enterprise was launched we have all been near death on more than one occasion tucker i am not talking close scrapes i mean when you are in a bad situation and you know this is it there is no way out and you have time to think about it tpol in the expanse when we were attempting to destroy sphere forty one i did not believe we would survive tucker what went through your mind tpol whether or not to transfer auxiliary power to the deflector array why do you ask tucker just curious corridortransporter alcove enterprise has arrived at a blue planet with a ring system and at least two fairsized moons reed the aenar compound is surrounded by a dampening field once you are inside you will not be able to contact the ship i would feel much better about this if you would take a couple of macos with you shran we go in there with a show of force we will not get a thing out of them archer we are going alone reed captain we do not know anything about these people archer that is why we are here energise andoria which is not the ringed planet as that is in the sky shran and archer materialise in a place of deep snow which has been cut into walls and doorways shran taste that air really gets the blood running archer puts up the hood on his parka then looking at shrans scanner archer twenty eight below shran lucky for you it is the middle of summer archer yeah shran the entrance is twenty metres ahead the vulcans say the desert teaches men the meaning of endurance but it is the ice that forges real strength archer it is hard to believe anything can survive here shran it is not easy andorian cities are built underground to take advantage of geothermal energy i did not see the sun till i was fifteen they wend their way through ice walls and shran wobbles then falls to his knees archer careful shran you do not have your balance back yet shran hands off pinkskin these tunnels branch out for thousands of kilometres not a good place to get lost control area nijil we will be ready to launch in twelve hours valdore and the pilot nijil he is resting valdore will he be ready nijil i will make sure that he is valdore spoken like a soldier nijil i am a scientist valdore we are all soldiers nijil from the moment we are born when we forget that we invite disaster you know i was once a senator nijil no valdore many years ago vrax and i were colleagues i even considered him a friend nijil what happened valdore i made the mistake of challenging the precept of unlimited expansion i asked the question is conquest truly the best course for our people and i was expelled nijil i am sorry valdore i am not trying to evoke your pity i want you to learn from my experience when i was led away from the senate chamber i vowed never to repeat my error and never to forget my purpose nijil i understand valdore continue with your preparations ice tunnels shran spots a lot of bright holes in an arch over their path shran icebores worms they live in the ice generate heat through a chemical reaction big swarm came through here a day or two ago archer i am sure phlox would love to get his hands on one shran best to avoid them when i was a boy i stumbled into a large den wound up with thirddegree burns over half my body he sways as they stand at the top of a cliff archer shran listen to me we should find another way shran afraid of heights captain he heads down a series of steps cut conveniently in the ice then suddenly falls the rest of the way and lands screaming in pain with a bright blue icicle stuck through his right leg archer dashes down to him archer shran shran the ice gave out beneath me he lifts his own leg off the icicle archer you are losing a lot of blood hold still we see someone is watching as archer tends shrans wound archer hold still bleedings stopped but if you move it could start again shran we can not stay here we will freeze to death archer archer to enterprise archer to enterprise shran we are well inside the dampening field archer it does not hurt to try how far are we from the aenar shran spots the watcher shran i think we just got a lot closer several more of the paleskinned paledressed people appear archer hello we need your help my friends been hurt lissan a woman we will assist you sickbay phlox there is not as much data on the neural interface as i would like tpol it is all we have phlox i can connect someone to the unit but it will be dangerous tucker how dangerous phlox if the interface malfunctions there could be severe neurolytic shock possibly resulting in brain damage tucker there is got to be some way we can make it safer phlox diagnostics will only tell us so much i am afraid tpol when can we test it phlox a day tucker i want to be the first one to try it out tpol you are not telepathic it would not be a true measure of the units effectiveness tucker well at least we will find out if it causes brain damage tpol i will test the unit tucker you are the ranking officer too risky tpol considering what is at stake the risk is acceptable tucker we could at least wait until the captain gets back tpol our goal should be to have the unit ready by the time he returns that means conducting a full series of tests the discussions closed we have a lot of work to do aenar city under the ice is a beautiful city of elegant curved buildings rising up in a massive cavern in a room with ice furniture shran is being tended on a bed covered with fur when the woman walks in lissan your wound is healing well you will be able to walk on your own in a few hours shran my thanks the aenar doctor leaves lissan you are captain archer archer you can read minds lissan we have a strict law here captain no one may enter anothers thoughts without permission i know your name because the andorian chancellor contacted us archer i need to speak with someone in authority lissan we assign our leaders as the need arises for this occasion i have been chosen as speaker archer i take it you know why we are here lissan i know what the andorians have told us someone is been attacking your ships and you believe we are involved archer it is a bit more complicated than that lissan it will save time and foster our trust if i can have your thoughts shran shakes his head archer go ahead lissan you have an interesting mind captain many facets archer thank you lissan some of those facets are in conflict shran that explains a lot archer shran lissan the evidence you have gathered appears irrefutable it seems there was an aenar controlling that ship archer but you are sceptical lissan we are a nonviolent people that a member of our race could because so much death it is extremely disturbing archer do you have any idea who it could be lissan there is one possibility shran who lissan a year ago one of our citizens disappeared while collecting icebores we assumed he would been killed in an accident but we never found his body shran now you know why lissan gareb would not be doing this voluntarily archer you think he was abducted lissan it is the best explanation shran it does not matter why he is doing it he has to be stopped lissan this device that you are building aboard your ship archer we are hoping it will disrupt the signal that is controlling the marauder lissan you will need one of us to operate it shran you owe us that much at least lissan i will consult with the others mess hall tucker coffee strong corridor walking back with his mug tpol commander tucker hey he keeps walking tpol trip i appreciate your concern for my safety tucker i just do not want enterprise to lose a good officer tpol i think you are letting your feelings impact your work tucker my works as good as it is ever been as far as my feelings go they are purely professional aenar city shran i have never been able to sleep with someone standing at the foot of my bed

so we have been told jhamel do you think he is in pain shran there is no way of knowing jhamel i have nightmares garebs bound locked in a strange cage he is calling for me he wants me to rescue him control area gareb is lead back in and put into the pilots chair nijil forgive me nijil gives gareb an injection sickbay tpol is in enterprises equivalent of garebs chair also with a helmet over her head when phlox switches it on phlox how do you feel tpol i just need a moment tucker whenever you are ready indicators moving doc phlox so far so good tucker i will be damned it is working tpol tenses and whimpers tucker she okay phlox her synaptic response is erratic tpol i will be fine phlox it is getting worse commander tucker that is enough shut it down he takes the helmet off her phlox you are all right tucker it worked tpol i will rest for a few minutes and then we will try again aenar city archer you said gareb was abducted if that is true do not you want to help him lissan not with violence archer we are trying to stop violence lissan i will not deny that your intentions are honourable but our decision stands shran forget it captain they have never even helped defend their own world we are wasting our time control area nijil systems ready valdore launch the drones two ships dash off to warp andoria ice tunnels jhamel you need to rest shran i have had enough rest archer we should clear the dampening field soon jhamel wait shran what is it jhamel a swarm shran i do not see anything then worms drop out of the ceiling in front of them and burrow into the floor jhamel it will take a few minutes for them to pass gareb and i loved chasing icebores once we followed a swarm for two hours caught hundreds of them we were almost at the surface my family was very worried they are going to be worried about me now shran are you sure you want to do this jhamel i will not abandon my brother what is it like your ship archer warm sickbay tucker whispers to phlox supposedly out of earshot of tpol tucker she wants to try again you think it is smart phlox you know the risks so does commander tpol commander she is doing her job tucker she is going to hurt herself phlox take my advice do not interfere tucker i can not believe i am getting this from you now has everyone on this ship gone crazy phlox not everyone tucker oh i am crazy phlox it is not your fault as far as i know there are no species in the galaxy that have mastered the art of mixing romance and vocation tucker you are the last one that should be giving me a lecture vulcan neuropressure was your idea phlox you were having trouble sleeping tucker what the hell am i going to do phlox this is the one ailment that is universally untreatable you will have to suffer through it andoria ice tunnels there is a familiar lot of holes in the ceiling and floor archer we have been here before jhamel he is right we are going in circles they are trying to stop us archer how jhamel they are not letting us see the path to the surface shran how could that be possible an image of lissan flickers on the path in front of them lissan it is time to come back jhamel i can not lissan they are fighting a war do you want to be a part of that jhamel i do not want to fight anyone i want to help my brother lissan help him by standing up for what we believe in archer she is doing what she thinks is right lissan she is betraying her people archer that is not true should not she be allowed to follow her own conscience lissan she is not following her conscience archer how do you know have you read her mind i thought that was against your custom lissan jhamel jhamel take my thoughts lissan you are certain this is what you want jhamel yes lissan very well her image vanishes and they see that they are at the surface with the ringed planet hanging in the sky captains starlog supplemental we have returned to enterprise where we received word that the cargo ship ticonderoga is missing corridor archer anything on long range sensors tpol not yet archer what is our eta tpol we will be at their last known coordinates in six hours archer tell malcolm to finish his upgrades to the targeting scanners if we run into that marauder again i want to make sure every shot counts tpol understood she leaves him and he walks straight into sickbay archer report tucker she is good to go jhamel is seated on the modified biobed archer whenever you are ready jhamel i am ready captain the helmet is lowered over her head tucker reads the monitor tucker a lot of movement fifty percent spike archer are you feeling all right shran we can stop anytime you like jhamel it is strangely enjoyable tucker she is maxed it out jhamel is that good archer very good jhamel is there another test we can try tucker we could simulate a course correction the biobed sways from side to side then she gasps phlox synaptic trouble shran shut it down they get the helmet off her and phlox gives her an injection captains starlog
